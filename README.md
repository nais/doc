# Welcome to the NAIS documentation repo

This repository is used to build a [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) site hosted on <https://doc.nais.io>!

All _documentation_ content resides inside the [docs](docs/) folder, with the general structure of the website defined in [mkdocs.yml](mkdocs.yml)'s `nav`-yaml key.

## Local preview-environment set-up

_**NB**_: Due to [limitations in the built-in](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/2108) `mkdocs serve`'s hot-reload feature, the described set-up relies on dodgy Docker networking.

### Poetry

```bash
poetry install
poetry run mkdocs serve
```

### Docker

#### Requirements

- `docker`
- `docker-compose`

#### How to set-up local preview environment

```shell
docker-compose up --detach --build && open localhost:8080
```

## GCP set-up

### First, ensure you're logged into GCP

```shell
gcloud auth login --update-adc
```

#### Then, run `terraform`

```shell
cd terraform/
&& terraform init -backend-config="bucket=terraform-prod-235011" \
&& terraform apply
```

Et voil√°! Presto!
