# Console

NAIS Console is a web-based interface for managing your workloads and services on the NAIS platform. It aims to provide a user-friendly way to interact with the platform, without needing to use the command line. 

It tries to provide you with insight into what you've got running on the platform. Is everything running as expected? Are you utilizing the resources you allocate effectively? 

The Console is designed to be self-service, meaning that you can manage your workloads and services without needing to involve the NAIS team. This includes creating, updating, and deleting workloads, as well as managing secrets and other resources.

Access Console at [console.<<tenant()>>.cloud.nais.io](https://console.<<tenant()>>.cloud.nais.io).
