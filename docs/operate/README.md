# Manage your workloads and services

This section covers how to manage your workloads and services on the NAIS platform. 
It describes the different options available, and how to use them.

Most of the management tasks can be done through the [NAIS Console](console.md), which is a web-based interface.

Some more advanced use-cases still requires you to interact with the platform using the Kubernetes CLI, `kubectl`.
