    :white_check_mark: OK:

## Telemetry

We collect simple telemetry about usage and error messages to get a view of which features are used, and what kind of problems our users have with using the tool.
If you don't want to share your usage you can opt out following the [Console Do Not Track (DNT)](https://consoledonottrack.com/) standard.

Copy this into your terminal, or even better add it to your shell-config (for example `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`):

``` shell
export DO_NOT_TRACK=1
```
