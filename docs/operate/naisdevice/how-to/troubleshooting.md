# Troubleshooting naisdevice

{%- if tenant() == "nav" %}
## Kolide

> naisdevice cannot connect, yet `/msg @Kolide status` reports that everything is fine

- Disconnect and re-connect `naisdevice`

> Kolide is reporting that your device has not been seen "in a long time"

- Reinstall ([uninstall](uninstall.md) -> [install](install.md))
{%- endif %}

## Browser not opening

> Browser does not open after you click connect.

Restart your default browser.

## Firewall blocks outgoing UDP connections

- Outgoing UDP connections to 51820/UDP must be open in your firewall and or modem provided by your ISP.
- Try using hotspot to eliminate router config problems (remember to disconnect from WiFi on your hotspot device and make sure you use 4G/5G by checking https://www.ipaddress.my/)

## Fresh start

- Stop naisdevice
- Remove configuration directory
    - Mac: `rm -r "~/Library/Application Support/naisdevice/"`
    - Linux: `rm -r "~/.config/naisdevice/"`
    - Windows: `rmdir /s "C:\ProgramData\NAV\naisdevice\"`
- Start naisdevice
