# naisdevice

naisdevice is the mechanism used by NAV employees to connect to internal services. It is based on [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com) for connectivity and [Kolide](https://www.kolide.com/) for ensuring that the device is in a healthy state.

naisdevice is only offered to NAV owned and consultancy owned devices. Privately owned devices (BYOD) is not currently supported. You might get som mileage off "your own machine", but please refrain from attempting to do so. There is a fair amount of red tape and GDPR concerns that prohibit this. 

If you want to understand more about how it works, head over to the [github repository](https://github.com/nais/device) and check out the project documentation.
