# Build and deploy

To make your application available to others, you need to build and deploy it.

NAIS attempts to make this as simple as possible by providing a set of composable [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).

Use these actions to compose your own build and deploy pipeline through [Github Actions workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows). 

## GitHub Actions

:books: [nais/docker-build-push](https://github.com/nais/docker-build-push)

:books: [nais/deploy](https://github.com/nais/deploy/tree/master/actions/deploy)

See the respective GitHub Action links for detailed configuration options.
