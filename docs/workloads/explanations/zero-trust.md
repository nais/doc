# Zero Trust

NAIS embraces the [zero trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_security_model) security model, where the core principle is to "never trust, always verify".

In NAIS every [workload](../README.md) is isolated by default - which means that it is not able to make _any_ outbound requests or receive _any_ incoming traffic unless explicitly allowed. 

## Inbound traffic

Depending on your use case and [environment](../reference/environments.md), you can allow inbound access in multiple ways:

```mermaid
graph TD
  A[Are your consumers in the same environment?]
  A --> |Yes| B[Are they in the same namespace?]
  A --> |No| Ingress[ðŸŽ¯ <a href='../../application/how-to/expose'>Expose through ingress</a>]
  B --> |Yes| InternalSameNS[ðŸŽ¯ <a href='../../how-to/access-policies#receive-requests-from-workloads-in-the-same-namespace'>Allow access in same namespace</a>]
  B --> |No| InternalOtherNS[ðŸŽ¯ <a href='../../how-to/access-policies#receive-requests-from-workloads-in-other-namespaces'>Allow access from other namespaces</a>]
```

If you define an [ingress](../reference/ingress.md), your application will be available to a given audience based on the domain.
**Access policies have no effect on ingress traffic**. This means that all traffic through an ingress is implicitly allowed.
Your workload is thus responsible for verifying requests if exposed through an ingress.

## Outbound traffic

For outbound traffic, you can allow access to other workloads in the same environment, or to external endpoints:

```mermaid
graph TD
  A[Is the service you want to call in the same environment?]
  A --> |Yes| B[Are they in the same namespace?]
  A --> |No| Internet[ðŸŽ¯ <a href='../../how-to/access-policies#send-requests-to-external-endpoints'>Allow access to external endpoint</a>]
  B --> |Yes| InternalSameNS[ðŸŽ¯ <a href='../../how-to/access-policies#send-requests-to-another-app-in-the-same-namespace'>Allow access to same namespace</a>]
  B --> |No| InternalOtherNS[ðŸŽ¯ <a href='../../how-to/access-policies#send-requests-to-other-app-in-another-namespace'>Allow access to other namespaces</a>]
```

For the native NAIS services - the platform takes care of this for you. For example, when you have a [database](../../persistence/postgres/README.md), the access policies required to reach the database will be created automatically.

## Example

Consider a simple application which consists of a frontend and a backend, where naturally the frontend needs to communicate with the backend.

This communication is denied by default as indicated by the red arrow.
![access-policy-1](../../assets/access-policy-1.png)

In order to fix this, the frontend needs to allow outbound traffic to the backend by adding the following access policy.

```yaml
spec:
  accessPolicy:
    outbound:
      - application: backend
```

![access-policy-2](../../assets/access-policy-2.png)

However - the frontend is still not allowed to make any requests to the backend.
The missing piece of the puzzle is adding an inbound policy to the backend like so:

```yaml
spec:
  accessPolicy:
    inbound:
      - application: frontend
```

![access-policy-3](../../assets/access-policy-3.png)

Now that both applications has explicitly declared their policies, the communication is allowed.
