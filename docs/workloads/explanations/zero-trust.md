# Zero Trust

NAIS embraces the [zero trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_security_model) security model, where the core principle is to "never trust, always verify".

In NAIS, every [workload](../README.md) is isolated by default. This means that workloads are not able to make _any_ outbound requests or receive _any_ incoming traffic unless explicitly allowed.

We use _access policies_ to specify which applications and services a workload can communicate with.
This is done by defining _inbound_ and _outbound_ policies in the workload's manifest.

{% if tenant() == "nav" %}
Access policies only restrict network traffic for workloads running in the [GCP environments](../reference/environments.md). They do not affect network traffic in the on-premise environments.
{% endif %}

## Inbound traffic

Depending on your use case and [environment](../reference/environments.md), you can allow inbound access in multiple ways:

```mermaid
graph TD
  A[Are your consumers in the same environment?]
  A --> |Yes| B[Are they in the same namespace?]
  A --> |No| Ingress[ðŸŽ¯ <a href='../../application/how-to/expose'>Expose through ingress</a>]
  B --> |Yes| InternalSameNS[ðŸŽ¯ <a href='../../how-to/access-policies#receive-requests-from-workloads-in-the-same-namespace'>Allow access in same namespace</a>]
  B --> |No| InternalOtherNS[ðŸŽ¯ <a href='../../how-to/access-policies#receive-requests-from-workloads-in-other-namespaces'>Allow access from other namespaces</a>]
```

Inbound policies defined in [`.spec.accessPolicy.inbound`](../application/reference/application-spec.md#accesspolicyinbound) are:

- enforced for _consumers in the same environment_ using [internal endpoints](../how-to/communication.md).
- **not** enforced for traffic through an [ingress](../reference/ingress.md).
{% if tenant() == "nav" %}
- enforced for authorizing consumers using [Entra ID](../../auth/entra-id/README.md) or [TokenX](../../auth/tokenx/README.md) regardless of environment.
{% endif %}

**Inbound policies do not affect ingress traffic**.
An ingress exposes your application to a selected audience, depending on the domain.
All traffic through an ingress is implicitly allowed.
Your workload is thus responsible for authorizing requests if exposed through an ingress.

## Outbound traffic

Outbound traffic can be allowed to either _other workloads in the same environment_ as well as _external endpoints_:

```mermaid
graph TD
  A[Is the service you want to call in the same environment?]
  A --> |Yes| B[Are they in the same namespace?]
  A --> |No| Internet[ðŸŽ¯ <a href='../../how-to/access-policies#send-requests-to-external-endpoints'>Allow access to external endpoint</a>]
  B --> |Yes| InternalSameNS[ðŸŽ¯ <a href='../../how-to/access-policies#send-requests-to-another-app-in-the-same-namespace'>Allow access to same namespace</a>]
  B --> |No| InternalOtherNS[ðŸŽ¯ <a href='../../how-to/access-policies#send-requests-to-other-app-in-another-namespace'>Allow access to other namespaces</a>]
```

Outbound policies defined in [`.spec.accessPolicy.outbound`](../application/reference/application-spec.md#accesspolicyoutbound) are:

- enforced when _consuming other workloads in the same environment_ through [internal endpoints](../how-to/communication.md) ([`.spec.accessPolicy.outbound.rules`](../application/reference/application-spec.md#accesspolicyoutboundrules)).
- enforced for all traffic to external endpoints ([`.spec.accessPolicy.outbound.external`](../application/reference/application-spec.md#accesspolicyoutboundexternal)).

**Ingresses are external endpoints**.
We recommend using [internal endpoints](../how-to/communication.md) to communicate with other workloads when possible.

Services offered by NAIS (such as [databases](../../persistence/postgres/README.md)) are automatically configured with necessary access policies.

## Example

Consider a simple application which consists of a frontend and a backend, where naturally the frontend needs to communicate with the backend.

This communication is denied by default as indicated by the red arrow.
![access-policy-1](../../assets/access-policy-1.png)

In order to fix this, the frontend needs to allow outbound traffic to the backend by adding the following access policy.

```yaml
spec:
  accessPolicy:
    outbound:
      - application: backend
```

![access-policy-2](../../assets/access-policy-2.png)

However - the frontend is still not allowed to make any requests to the backend.
The missing piece of the puzzle is adding an inbound policy to the backend like so:

```yaml
spec:
  accessPolicy:
    inbound:
      - application: frontend
```

![access-policy-3](../../assets/access-policy-3.png)

Now that both applications has explicitly declared their policies, the communication is allowed.
