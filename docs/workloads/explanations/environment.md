# The runtime environment

NAIS provides you with multiple environments for you to run you workloads in. See the [full list of available environments](../reference/environments.md).

Inside each environment, you and your team will have your own isolated namespace where you can run your workloads.

Within an environment, you can [communicate directly](../how-to/communication.md) with other workloads both within your own namespace as well as others provided you have defined the necessary [access policies](../how-to/access-policies.md).
See the [zero trust](zero-trust.md) explanation for more information.

Each environment provides you with a set of ingress/domains that you can use to expose your services for different audiences. See the [full list of available domains](../reference/environments.md).
