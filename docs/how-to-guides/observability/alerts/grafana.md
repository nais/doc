# Create Grafana alert

This guide shows you how to create an alert for your application in Grafana. While we recommend [creating alerts in Prometheus][howto-prometheus-alert], Grafana can in some cases be a more user-friendly alternative.

[howto-prometheus-alert]: ./prometheus.md

## 0. Prerequisites

You will need to have a Grafana Dashboard for your application. If you don't have one, you can follow the [Create Dashboard in Grafana][howto-grafana-dashboard] guide.

[howto-grafana-dashboard]: ../metrics/dashboard.md

## 1. Create Alert

1. Open your Grafana Dashboard and click on the bell icon in the top right corner.
