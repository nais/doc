# Aiven Data Processor Agreement

NAV has, based on the Schrems II verdict that invalidated The EU-US Privacy Shield transfer mechanism, decided that all cloud services and all storage of data in cloud services shall take place in the EU / EEA. Support is to be given from Aiven supportcenters in EU/EÃ˜S. This is already the case regarding Kafka service at Aiven, so the [DPA between NAV and Aiven](https://navno.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/Risikovurderinger668/EdtbCu04JCdEkStS2kV5V_MBb-jDYfwyqa8rnnraSJ7pTg?e=Wj6M6B) is still valid.
