# Application risk assessments (ROS)

Before deploying any application to nais, the team owning the application must conduct a risk assessment \(ROS\) in the [TryggNok tool](https://apps.powerapps.com/play/f8517640-ea01-46e2-9c09-be6b05013566) \(NAV internal link\). This risk assessment should be kept reasonably up-to-date through the lifetime of the application.

When conducting the risk assessment, any assumptions about underlying component risks can be verified by checking the [Platform risk assessments](app-ros.md). These may also be referred to in the application risk assessment.

For details about the ROS process, see the [ROS documentation](https://navno.sharepoint.com/sites/intranett-it/SitePages/IT-sikkerhet-og-risikovurderinger.aspx) \(NAV internal link\).
