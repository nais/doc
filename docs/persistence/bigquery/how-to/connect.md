# Using BigQuery from your application

When connecting your BigQuery client you need to specify the project ID and the dataset ID.
The project ID is available in the `GCP_TEAM_PROJECT_ID` environment variable.
There's no automatic environment variable for the dataset ID.

See the [BigQuery documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/samples) for examples on how to use BigQuery with your language of choice.
