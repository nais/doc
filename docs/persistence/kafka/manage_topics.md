# Managing topics and access

!!! warning
    This feature applies only to _Aiven hosted Kafka_. On-premises Kafka is deprecated, and creating new topics on-premises was disabled summer 2021. For on-premises Kafka, see [on-premises Kafka documentation](https://confluence.adeo.no/display/AURA/Kafka).

## Creating topics and defining access

Creating or modifying a `Topic` Kubernetes resource will trigger topic creation and ACL management with Aiven \(hosted Kafka provider\). The topic name will be prefixed with your team namespace, thus in the example below, the fully qualified topic name will be `myteam.mytopic`. This name will be set in the `.status.fullyQualifiedName` field on your Topic resource once the Topic is synchronized to Aiven.

To add access to this topic for your application, see the next section: _Accessing topics from an application_.

Topic resources can only be specified in GCP clusters. However, applications might access topics from any cluster, including on-premises. For details, read the next section.

Currently, use the `nav-dev` pool for development, and `nav-prod` for production.
If you need cross-environment communications, use the `nav-infrastructure` pool, but please consult the NAIS team before you do.

| Pool                 | Min. replication | Max. replication | Topic declared in | Available from                               |
|:---------------------|:-----------------|:-----------------|:------------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| `nav-dev`            | 2                | 3                | `dev-gcp`         | `dev-gcp`, `dev-fss`                         |
| `nav-prod`           | 2                | 9                | `prod-gcp`        | `prod-gcp`, `prod-fss`                       |
| `nav-infrastructure` | 2                | 3                | `prod-gcp`        | `dev-gcp`, `dev-fss`, `prod-gcp`, `prod-fss` |

### ACLs

On your topic, you must define ACLs to manage access to the topic.
Access is granted to applications, belonging to teams.
Every ACL must contain team, application and which access to grant.
Possible access is `read`, `write` and `readwrite`.

It is possible to use simple wildcards (`*`) in both team and application names, which matches any character any number of times.
Be aware that due to the way ACLs are generated and length limits, the ends of long names can be cut, eliminating any wildcards at the end.


=== "topic.yaml"
    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: kafka.nais.io/v1
    kind: Topic
    metadata:
      name: mytopic
      namespace: myteam
      labels:
        team: myteam
    spec:
      pool: nav-dev
      acl:
        - team: myteam
          application: ownerapp
          access: readwrite   # read, write, readwrite
        - team: bigteam
          application: consumerapp1
          access: read
        - team: bigteam
          application: consumerapp2
          access: read
        - team: bigteam
          application: producerapp1
          access: write
        - team: producerteam
          application: producerapp
          access: write
        - team: trusted-team
          application: *
          access: read     # All applications from this trusted-team has read
        - team: *
          application: aivia
          access: read     # Applications named aivia from any team has read
        - team: myteam
          application: rapid-*
          access: readwrite   # Applications from myteam with names starting with `rapid-` has readwrite access
    ```

### Configuration

Topics may be configured beyond the default settings for various use cases. 
Only a subset of [all the possible topic-level configurations](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#topicconfigs) are available.


=== "topic.yaml"
    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: kafka.nais.io/v1
    kind: Topic
    metadata:
      name: mytopic
      namespace: myteam
      labels:
        team: myteam
    spec:
      pool: nav-dev
      config:  # optional; all fields are optional too; defaults shown
        cleanupPolicy: delete  # delete, compact, compact,delete
        maxMessageBytes: 1048588  # 1 MiB
        minimumInSyncReplicas: 2
        partitions: 1
        replication: 3  # see min/max requirements
        retentionBytes: -1  # -1 means unlimited
        retentionHours: 168  # -1 means unlimited
        segmentHours: 168  # 1 week
      acl:
        - team: myteam
          application: ownerapp
          access: readwrite
    ```

#### Maximum message size

The `maxMessageBytes` configuration controls the largest record batch size allowed by Kafka. 
It has a default value of `1048588` (1 MiB). 

Generally speaking, Kafka is not designed to handle large messages. 
We recommend that you do not increase this value above the defaults, unless absolutely necessary. 

To keep your Kafka messages below the size limit, do consider implementing strategies such as:

- using an efficient serialization format such as Avro or Protobuf
- using compression - set the `compression.type` configuration for your producer(s)
- using patterns such as [claim-checks](https://developer.confluent.io/patterns/event-processing/claim-check/) or [splitting messages into multiple segments](https://developer.confluent.io/patterns/event-processing/event-chunking/)

If you do increase the `maxMessageBytes` value, you will need to configure all your producers and consumers as well to accommodate this.

For producers:

- set `max.request.size` equal to `maxMessageBytes`

For consumers:

- set `max.partition.fetch.bytes` equal to `maxMessageBytes`

#### Segment rolling

The `segmentHours` configuration controls the period of time after which Kafka will force the log to roll even if the 
segment file isn't full to ensure that retention can delete or compact old data. This can be useful for GDPR purposes.

### Data catalog metadata

If your topic exposes data meant for consumption by a wider audience, you should define some metadata describing the topic and its contents. This data will be automatically scraped and added to the [internal data catalog](https://data.adeo.no). If the `catalog` key is set to `public`, the topic metadata is also published to the [external data catalog](https://data.nav.no) and the [National Data Catalog](https://data.norge.no/).

Syntax:

=== "topic.yaml"
    ```
    apiVersion: kafka.nais.io/v1
    kind: Topic
    metadata:
      annotations:
        dcat.data.nav.no/<key>: "<value>"
    ```

Use the following annotations and prefix them with `dcat.data.nav.no/`. Default values will be used where not supplied.

### Permanently deleting topic and data

!!! warning
    Permanent deletes are irreversible. Enable this feature only as a step to completely remove your data.


When a `Topic` resource is deleted from a Kubernetes cluster, the Kafka topic is still retained, and the data kept intact. If you need to remove data and start from scratch, you must add the following annotation to your `Topic` resource:

=== "topic.yaml"
    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: kafka.nais.io/v1
    kind: Topic
    metadata:
      annotations:
        kafka.nais.io/removeDataWhenResourceIsDeleted: "true"
    ```

When this annotation is in place, deleting the topic resource from Kubernetes will also delete the Kafka topic and all of its data.

## Accessing topics from an application

Adding `.kafka.pool` to your `Application` spec will inject Kafka credentials into your pod. Your application needs to follow some design guidelines; see the next section on [application design guidelines](application.md#application-design-guidelines). Make sure that the topic name matches the `fullyQualifiedName` found in the Topic resource, e.g. `myteam.mytopic`.

=== "nais.yaml"
    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: nais.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Application
    metadata:
      name: consumerapp
      namespace: myteam
      labels:
        team: myteam
    spec:
      kafka:
        pool: nav-dev    # enum of nav-dev, nav-prod
    ```
