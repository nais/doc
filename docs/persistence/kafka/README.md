# Kafka

NAV uses Aiven hosted Kafka, the on-premise version of Kafka has been deprecated since 2021. Start using Kafka by creating a `Topic` resource in one of our Kubernetes clusters.

Upon defining a Topic, [Kafkarator](https://github.com/nais/kafkarator) will create the Topic in one of the Kafka _pools_. A pool is a highly available, replicated Kafka cluster running at Aiven. After the topic is created, Kafkarator will add relevant users to the topic's access control list \(ACL\).

When an application that uses Kafka is deployed, [Aivenator](https://github.com/nais/aivenator) will orchestrate generation of users and credentials. These credentials are made available to applications through a _Secret_ in the relevant team namespace. This secret is automatically mounted by Naiserator into application pods as environment variables and files.

For a list of variables, see [accessing topics from an application](manage_topics.md#accessing-topics-from-an-application).
