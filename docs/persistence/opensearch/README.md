# OpenSearch

OpenSearch is a fork of Elasticsearch that is maintained by Amazon. It is a drop-in replacement for Elasticsearch, and is fully compatible with the Elasticsearch API. It is a community-driven project that is open source and free to use.

OpenSearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of solving a growing number of use cases. It is a good choice for storing data that is not relational in nature.

NAIS offers OpenSearch via [Aiven](https://aiven.io/). Aiven OpenSearch can be used by applications in all environments, but must be *defined* in a GCP cluster.
