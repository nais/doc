All Postgres databases running on Google Cloud Platform are integrated with [Cloud Monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring) to provide metrics and alerts. You can use these metrics to monitor the health and performance of your database.

Monitoring data from your datatabse can be viewed directly in the Google Cloud Console, Nais Console or integraded directly in you Grafana dashboard.

We also suggest keeping an eye on your Query performance using Google Cloud's [Query Insights](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/insights) that is enabled by default on all Postgres instances.
