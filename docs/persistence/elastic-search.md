# Elastic Search

The NAIS platform offers Elastic Search via [Aiven](https://aiven.io/).

## Get your own
As there are few teams that need an Elastic Search instance we use a IaC-repo to provision each instance.
Head over to [aiven-iac](https://github.com/navikt/aiven-iac#elastic-search) to learn how to get your own instance.

### Username and password
For now we are manually distributing the username and password for each instance.
To make it easier for you, we're making four different users: admin, read, write, read/write.

## Access from Nais-app
If you need access from an application, use the following [nais.yaml-reference](../nais-application/application.md#elasticinstance).

## Access from laptop
With Naisdevice you have access to the _aiven-prod_ gateway.
This is a JITA (just in time access) gateway, so you need to describe why, but the access is automatically given.

### Kibana
The URL for Kibana is the same as the Elastic instance, but using port 443 (regular https).

## Support
We do not offer support on Elastic Search as software, but questions about Aiven and provisioning can be directed to [#pig_aiven](https://nav-it.slack.com/archives/C018L1JATBQ) on Slack.

## Alerts
We recommend that you set up your own alerts so that you can react to problems in your Elastic instance. 
Aiven uses Telegraf to collect and present metrics, so available metrics can be found in the [Telegraf documentation](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf).

We have configured our Prometheus instances in GCP to scrape the Elastic clusters in Aiven, so these metrics should be available in Grafana.
New Elastic clusters currently need to be manually added to the Prometheus config, so if you can't find your cluster, please poke us.

Particularly relevant input plugins are:

- [elasticsearch](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/elasticsearch)
- [mem](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/mem)
- [cpu](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/cpu)
- [diskio](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/diskio)
- [disk](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/disk)

O'Reilly has a useful [article](https://www.oreilly.com/content/10-elasticsearch-metrics-to-watch/) about metrics to watch in an Elastic cluster.

[Awesome prometheus alerts](https://awesome-prometheus-alerts.grep.to/rules#elasticsearch) is another good source of alerts to look out for.

Some metrics that might be useful to watch, based on above article (We need feedback on this list, as we have no practical experience to lean on):

- `elasticsearch_cluster_health_status_code`
- `elasticsearch_cluster_health_active_shards`
- `elasticsearch_cluster_health_initializing_shards`
- `elasticsearch_cluster_health_relocating_shards`

- `elasticsearch_jvm_mem_heap_used_percent`
- `elasticsearch_jvm_gc_collectors_old_collection_time_in_millis`
- `elasticsearch_jvm_gc_collectors_young_collection_time_in_millis`

- `elasticsearch_jvm_mem_pools_young_used_in_byte` vs. `elasticsearch_jvm_mem_pools_young_max_in_bytes`
