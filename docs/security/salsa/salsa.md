# Salsa

## What is SLSA

[SLSA](https://slsa.dev/) is short for _Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts_ pronounced `salsa`.

It is a security framework, essentially a checklist comprising standards and controls aimed at preventing tampering,
enhancing integrity, and securing both packages and infrastructure within our projects.

## SLSA in NAIS

If you utilize the [nais/docker-build-push](https://github.com/nais/docker-build-push) action for building and pushing
your container image, you will automatically
receive a signed attestation/SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) for your container image and its dependencies. This SBOM
will be uploaded to your container registry along with your image. The attestation is generated by
the [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-action) GitHub
action and signed using [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign).

Upon deploying your image to NAIS, the attestation will undergo verification by the NAIS
platform ([picante](https://github.com/nais/picante)) and will be
uploaded to an SBOM analysis platform known as [Dependency-Track](https://dependencytrack.org/). In Dependency-Track,
you can examine the attestation as
well as the vulnerabilities present in your image and its dependencies.

### Usage

Simply add [nais/docker-build-push](https://github.com/nais/docker-build-push) to your workflow.

```yaml
          - uses: nais/docker-build-push@v0
            id: docker-push
            with:
              team: myteam # required
              salsa: true # optional, defaults to true
              project_id: ${{ vars.NAIS_MANAGEMENT_PROJECT_ID }} # required, but is defined as an organization variable
              identity_provider: ${{ secrets.NAIS_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER }} # required, but is defined as an organization secret
              # ... other options removed for readability

```

!!! Opt-out
    Opt-out from salsa

    If you want to opt-out from salsa you can set the salsa input to false

    ```yaml
              salsa: false
    ```

See [nais/docker-build-push](https://github.com/nais/docker-build-push) for more options.

### View and analyze dependencies

[Dependency-Track](https://dependencytrack.org/) has a single instance that controls all clusters, and it contains both
attestations and vulnerabilities for all signed attestations deployed, except those that have chosen to opt out
from salsa. You can access the Dependency-Track user interface through the following URL:

https://salsa.[tenantname].cloud.nais.io
For instance, you can visit [nav-salsa](https://salsa.nav.cloud.nais.io) as an example.

To log in, use the OpenID button, which will redirect you to your organization's identity provider.

In Dependency-Track, each container in a deployment will have its own project. The project's name is a combination of
the cluster, team name, application name, and the container image name. You can search within projects using the
following tags:

* Team
* Application
* Image

Below is a screenshot of a project utilizing the dependency graph within Dependency-Track:

[Dependency-Track](https://dependencytrack.org/) has a ton of features so check out
the [documentation](https://docs.dependencytrack.org/) for more information.

### Language support

SBOM generation for
different [languages/build tools are dictated by Trivy](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/v0.40/docs/scanner/vulnerability/language/)

#### Known limitations and alternatives

Due to Trivy, you will get a flat graph of dependencies. This is because Trivy does not support Gradle's or Maven
dependency resolution.
Trivy parses the .jar files directly and does not have access to the dependency resolution information.
Here is 2 alternatives:

Alternative 1, GitHub workflow for Gradle users.

No need to add any plugins to your build file. You will get a deep graph of nested transitive dependencies.
The generated sbom will be located in the ` dependency-graph-reports` directory.
The action requires `contents: write` permission.

Gradle and Maven plugins for a deep graph of nested transitive dependencies.

!!! Gradle Plugin
    Add the following plugin to your `build.gradle*` file.

    ```groovy
        id("org.cyclonedx.bom") version "1.7.4"
    ```

    In your workflow you can generate a SBOM with the following gradle task command:

    ```yaml
        - name: Generate and output SBOM
          run: ./gradlew cyclonedxBom
    ```

    The SBOM will be default located at `build/reports/bom.json`. Pass the SBOM to the `nais/docker-build-push` action with the following input:

    ```yaml
        uses: nais/docker-build-push@v0
        with:
          byosbom: build/reports/bom.json
    ```
  
    For more info about settings check out the [CycloneDx Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-gradle-plugin)

!!! Maven Plugin
    Add the following to your `pom.xml` file.

    ```xml
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.cyclonedx</groupId>
                <artifactId>cyclonedx-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <phase>package</phase>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>makeAggregateBom</goal>
                        </goals>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    ```

    In your workflow you can generate a SBOM with the following maven command:

    ```yaml
        - name: Generate and output SBOM
          run: ./mvnw package
    ```

    The SBOM will be default located at `target/bom.json`. Pass the SBOM to the `nais/docker-build-push` action with the following input:

    ```yaml
        uses: nais/docker-build-push@v0
        with:
          byosbom: target/bom.json
    ```
    For more info about settings check out the [CycloneDx Maven Plugin](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-maven-plugin)

#### Use nais/attest-sign directly

When using the `nais/attest-sign` action. You can pass the SBOM to the action with the following input:

```yaml
    uses: nais/attest-sign@v1.x.x
    with:
      sbom: path/to/bom.json
```
