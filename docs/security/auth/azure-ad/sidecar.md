# Azure AD sidecar

The Azure AD sidecar is a reverse proxy that provides functionality to perform Azure AD login and logout for end-users.

!!! warning "Availability"

    The sidecar is only available in the [Google Cloud Platform](../../../workloads/reference/environments.md#google-cloud-platform-gcp) clusters.

## Spec

!!! danger "Port Configuration"
    The sidecar will occupy and use the ports `7564` and `7565`.

    Ensure that you do **not** bind to these ports from your application as they will be overridden.

Minimal example below.

=== "nais.yaml"
    ```yaml
    spec:
      azure:
        application:
          enabled: true
        sidecar:
          enabled: true
    ```

See the [NAIS manifest reference](../../../workloads/application/reference/application-spec.md#azuresidecar) for the complete specification.

The above example will provision a unique Azure AD application and enable a sidecar that uses said application.

For configuration of the Azure AD application itself, see [the Configuration page](configuration.md).

## Usage

!!! info "Prerequisites"

    - If you're unfamiliar with Azure AD, review the [core concepts](README.md#concepts).
    - Ensure that you define at least one [ingress](../../../workloads/application/reference/application-spec.md#ingresses) for your application.
    - Ensure that you configure [user access](configuration.md#users) for your application. **Users are not granted access by default**.

Try out a basic user flow:

1. Visit your application's login endpoint (`https://<ingress>/oauth2/login`) to trigger a login.
2. After logging in, you should be redirected back to your application.
3. All further requests to your application should now have an `Authorization` header with the user's access token as a [Bearer token](../../../auth/explanations/README.md#bearer-token)
4. Visit your application's logout endpoint (`https://<ingress>/oauth2/logout`) to trigger a logout.
5. You will be redirected to Azure AD for logout, and then back to your application's ingress.
6. Success!

**See [Wonderwall](../wonderwall.md#usage) for further usage details.**

### Token Validation

The sidecar attaches an `Authorization` header with the user's `access_token` as a [Bearer token](../../../auth/explanations/README.md#bearer-token), as long as the user is authenticated.

It is your responsibility to **validate the token** before granting access to resources.

For any endpoint that requires authentication; **deny access** if the request does not contain a valid Bearer token.

[:octicons-arrow-right-24: Read more about Token Validation](usage.md#token-validation)

## Next Steps

The access token that Wonderwall provides should only be accepted and used by your application.

To access other applications, you need a token scoped to the target application.

For Azure AD, use the [on-behalf-of grant](usage.md#oauth-20-on-behalf-of-grant) to exchange the token for a new token.

!!! tip "Recommended: JavaScript Library"

    See <https://github.com/navikt/oasis> for an opinionated JavaScript library for token validation and exchange.
