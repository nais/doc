# TokenX

## Abstract 

!!! abstract
    ### What is TokenX?

    **TokenX** is the short term for [OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange](https://github.com/nais/tokendings) implemented in the context of Kubernetes.

    It consists of mainly 3 components:

    * [Tokendings](https://github.com/nais/tokendings) - an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server implementing the OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange specification
    * [Jwker](https://github.com/nais/jwker/) - a Kubernetes operator responsible for registering applications as OAuth 2.0 clients in Tokendings
    * [Naiserator](https://github.com/nais/naiserator/) - a Kubernetes operator that handles the lifecycle of applications on the [NAIS platform](https://nais.io/)

    In short, TokenX is a OAuth 2.0 compliant add-on that enables and allows your application to maintain the [zero trust](../../appendix/zero-trust.md) _networking_ principles (together with components such as [**LinkerD**](https://linkerd.io/)). It does this by allowing applications to exchange and acquire properly scoped security tokens in order to securely communicate with each other.

    Interested readers may find more technical details in the [Tokendings documentation](https://github.com/nais/tokendings).

    ### Why do I need TokenX?

    In a [zero trust](../../appendix/zero-trust.md) architecture, one cannot rely on traditional boundaries such as **security zones** and **security gateways**. Such security measures are no longer required for applications that leverage TokenX correctly as each application is self-contained within its own zone; requiring specific tokens in order to communicate with other applications.

    Using TokenX correctly throughout a call-chain also ensures that the identity of the original caller or subject \(e.g. an end-user\) is propagated while still maintaining proper scoping and security between each application.

    ### When do I need TokenX?

    There are primarily two distinct cases where one must use TokenX:

    1. You have a user facing app using [ID-porten](idporten.md) that should perform calls to another app on behalf of a user.
    2. You have an app receiving tokens issued from Tokendings and need to call another app while still propagating the original user context.

???+ info "Overview of flow"
    ![The diagram shows 3 processes. The first one is OpenID Connect login. Logging in as an enduser, the token is collected from the ID provider using API1. Code snippet: { sub: “enduser” aud: “API1” iss: “ID-provider” } The second process is gettinig a tooken for API 2 (OAuth 2.0 Token exchange). AP1 gets a token for API2 based on ID-provider token, using TokenDings to verify token check access policy: Can API1 invoke API 2, issuing a new tokoen for API2. Code snippet: { sub: “enduser” aud: “API2” iss: “TokenDings” } The third process is calling API2 with JWT Bearer token. API1 calls API2 with token from TokenDings. API2 verifies token with access control, based on the enduser and returns information to API 1, which displays the information to the end user.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nais/tokendings/master/doc/downstream_example.svg)

## Configuration

### Spec

See the [NAIS manifest](../../nais-application/application.md#tokenxenabled).

### Getting Started

=== "nais.yaml"
    ```yaml
    spec:
      tokenx:
        enabled: true
      accessPolicy:
        inbound:
          rules:
            - application: app-2
            - application: app-3
              namespace: team-a
            - application: app-4
              namespace: team-b
              cluster: prod-gcp
    ```

### Access Policies

In order for other applications to acquire a token targeting your application, you **must explicitly** specify inbound access policies that authorizes these other applications.

Thus, the access policies defines _authorization_ on the application layer, and is enforced by [Tokendings](https://github.com/nais/tokendings) on token exchange operations.

For example:

```yaml
spec:
  tokenx:
    enabled: true
  accessPolicy:
    inbound:
      rules:
        - application: app-1
        - application: app-2
          namespace: team-a
        - application: app-3
          namespace: team-b
          cluster: prod-gcp
```

The above configuration authorizes the following applications:

* application `app-1` running in the **same namespace** and **same cluster** as your application
* application `app-2` running in the namespace `team-a` in the **same cluster**
* application `app-3` running in the namespace `team-b` in the cluster `prod-gcp`

## Usage

### Runtime Variables & Credentials

Enabling TokenX will expose the following runtime environment variables and files \(under the directory `/var/run/secrets/nais.io/jwker`\) for your application:

---

#### `TOKEN_X_WELL_KNOWN_URL`

???+ note

    The well-known URL for the OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange authorization server (in this case, Tokendings) [metadata document](concepts/actors.md#well-known-url-metadata-document).

    Example value: `https://tokendings.dev-gcp.nais.io/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
---

#### `TOKEN_X_CLIENT_ID`

???+ note
    
    [Client ID](concepts/actors.md#client-id) that uniquely identifies the application in TokenX. It has the following naming scheme:

    ```text
    <cluster>:<metadata.namespace>:<metadata.name>
    ```

    This value should be used in the [client assertion](tokenx.md#client-authentication) when exchanging a token with [Tokendings](https://github.com/nais/tokendings).

---

#### `TOKEN_X_PRIVATE_JWK`

???+ note

    [Private JWK](concepts/cryptography.md#private-keys) containing an RSA key belonging to your client. Used to sign client assertions during [client authentication](tokenx.md#client-authentication).

    ```json
    {
        "use": "sig",
        "kty": "RSA",
        "kid": "jXDxKRE6a4jogcc4HgkDq3uVgQ0",
        "n": "xQ3chFsz...",
        "e": "AQAB",
        "d": "C0BVXQFQ...",
        "p": "9TGEF_Vk...",
        "q": "zb0yTkgqO...",
        "dp": "7YcKcCtJ...",
        "dq": "sXxLHp9A...",
        "qi": "QCW5VQjO..."
    }
    ```

#### `TOKEN_X_ISSUER`

???+ note

    `issuer` from the [metadata discovery document](concepts/actors.md#issuer).

    Example value: `https://tokendings.dev-gcp.nais.io`

---

#### `TOKEN_X_JWKS_URI`

???+ note

    `jwks_uri` from the [metadata discovery document](concepts/actors.md#jwks-endpoint-public-keys).

    Example value: `https://tokendings.dev-gcp.nais.io/jwks`

---

#### `TOKEN_X_TOKEN_ENDPOINT`

???+ note

    `token_endpoint` from the [metadata discovery document](concepts/actors.md#token-endpoint).

    Example value: `https://tokendings.dev-gcp.nais.io/token`

---

### Client Authentication

Your application **must** authenticate itself with [Tokendings](https://github.com/nais/tokendings) when attempting to perform token exchanges. To do so, you must create a [client assertion](concepts/actors.md#client-assertion).

In other words, you must create a [JWT](concepts/tokens.md#jwt) that is signed by your application using the [private key](concepts/cryptography.md#private-keys) contained within [`TOKEN_X_PRIVATE_JWK`](tokenx.md#token_x_private_jwk).

The assertion **must** contain the following claims:

| Claim     | Example Value                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|:----------|:-------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`sub`** | `dev-gcp:aura:app-a`                       | The _subject_ of the token. Must be set to your application's own [`client_id`](tokenx.md#token_x_client_id).                                                                                                                        |
| **`iss`** | `dev-gcp:aura:app-a`                       | The _issuer_ of the token. Must be set to your application's own [`client_id`](tokenx.md#token_x_client_id).                                                                                                                         |
| **`aud`** | `https://tokendings.dev-gcp.nais.io/token` | The _audience_ of the token. Must be set to the `token_endpoint` of [Tokendings](https://github.com/nais/tokendings). The value of this exists in the metadata found at the [well-known endpoint](tokenx.md#token_x_well_known_url). |
| **`jti`** | `83c580a6-b479-426d-876b-267aa9848e2f`     | The _JWT ID_ of the token. Used to uniquely identify a token. Set this to a UUID or similar.                                                                                                                                         |
| **`nbf`** | `1597783152`                               | `nbf` stands for _not before_. It identifies the time \(seconds after Epoch\) before which the JWT MUST NOT be accepted for processing.                                                                                              |
| **`iat`** | `1597783152`                               | `iat` stands for _issued at_. It identifies the time \(seconds after Epoch\) in which the JWT was issued \(or created\).                                                                                                             |
| **`exp`** | `1597783272`                               | `exp` is the _expiration time_ \(seconds after Epoch\) of the token. This **must** not be more than **120** seconds after `nbf` and `iat`. That is, the maximum lifetime of the token must be no greater than **120 seconds**.       |

Additionally, the headers of the assertion must contain the following parameters:

| Parameter | Value                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                        |
|:----------|:---------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`kid`** | `93ad09a5-70bc-4858-bd26-5ff4a0c5f73f` | The key identifier of the key used to sign the assertion. This identifier is available in the JWK found in [`TOKEN_X_PRIVATE_JWK`](tokenx.md#token_x_private_jwk). |
| **`typ`** | `JWT`                                  | Represents the type of this JWT. Set this to `JWT`.                                                                                                                |
| **`alg`** | `RS256`                                | Represents the cryptographic algorithm used to secure the JWT. Set this to `RS256`.                                                                                |

An assertion should be unique and not be reused when authenticating with _Tokendings_ in accordance with the 
[security considerations in RFC 7521](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7521#section-8.2).

That is, every request to Tokendings should contain a unique client assertion:

- Set the JWT ID (`jti`) claim to a unique value, such as an UUID.
- Set the JWT expiry (`exp`) claim so that the lifetime of the token is reasonably low.
    - Tokendings allows a _maximum_ lifetime of 120 seconds.
    - A lifetime between 10-30 seconds should be fine for most situations.

#### Example Client Assertion Values

**Header**

```json
{
  "kid": "93ad09a5-70bc-4858-bd26-5ff4a0c5f73f",
  "typ": "JWT",
  "alg": "RS256"
}
```

**Payload**

```json
{
  "sub": "prod-gcp:namespace-gcp:gcp-app",
  "aud": "https://tokendings.prod-gcp.nais.io/token",
  "nbf": 1592508050,
  "iss": "prod-gcp:namespace-gcp:gcp-app",
  "exp": 1592508171,
  "iat": 1592508050,
  "jti": "fd9717d3-6889-4b22-89b8-2626332abf14"
}
```

### Exchanging a token

In order to acquire a token from [Tokendings](https://github.com/nais/tokendings) that is properly scoped to a given target application, you must exchange an existing _subject token_ \(i.e. a token that contains a subject, in this case a citizen end-user\).

Tokendings will then issue an `access_token` in JWT format, based on the parameters set in the token request. The token can then be used as a [**Bearer token**](concepts/tokens.md#bearer-token) in the Authorization header when calling your target API on behalf of the aforementioned subject.

#### Prerequisites

* You have a _subject token_ in the form of an `access_token` issued by one of the following providers:
    - [ID-porten](idporten.md)
    - Tokendings
* You have a [client assertion](tokenx.md#client-authentication) that _authenticates_ your application.

#### Exchange Request

The following denotes the required parameters needed to perform an exchange request.

| Parameter               | Value                                                    | Comment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|:------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `grant_type`            | `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange`        | The identifier of the OAuth 2.0 grant to use, in this case the OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange grant. This grants allows applications to exchange one token for a new one containing much of the same information while still being correctly "scoped" in terms of OAuth. |
| `client_assertion_type` | `urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer` | Identifies the type of _assertion_ the client/application will use to authenticate itself to Tokendings, in this case a JWT.                                                                                                                                       |
| `client_assertion`      | A serialized JWT identifying the calling app             | The [client assertion](tokenx.md#client-authentication); a JWT signed by the calling client/application used to identify said client/application.                                                                                                                  |
| `subject_token_type`    | `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt`                   | Identifies the type of token that will be exchanged with a new one, in this case a JWT                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `subject_token`         | A serialized JWT, the token that should be exchanged     | The actual token \(JWT\) containing the signed-in user. Should be an `access_token`.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `audience`              | The identifier of the app you wish to use the token for  | Identifies the intended audience for the resulting token, i.e. the target app you request a token for. This value shall be the `client_id` of the target app using the naming scheme `<cluster>:<namespace>:<appname>` e.g. `prod-fss:namespace1:app1`             |

The request should then sent to the `token_endpoint` of Tokendings, the value of which exists in the metadata found at the [well-known endpoint](tokenx.md#token_x_well_known_url).

???+ example
    ```http
    POST /token HTTP/1.1
    Host: tokendings.prod-gcp.nais.io
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange&
    client_assertion_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer&
    client_assertion=eY...............&
    subject_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt&
    subject_token=eY...............&
    audience=prod-fss:namespace1:app1
    ```

#### Exchange Response

Tokendings will respond with a JSON object

???+ example
    ```json
    {
      "access_token" : "eyJraWQiOi..............",
      "issued_token_type" : "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token",
      "token_type" : "Bearer",
      "expires_in" : 899
    }
    ```

If performance is a concern, the token can be cached for reuse within the validity period indicated by the `expires_in` field.

#### Exchange Error Response

If the exchange request is invalid, Tokendings will respond with a structured error, as specified in 
[RFC 8693, Section 2.2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8693.html#name-error-response):

???+ example
    ```json
    {
        "error_description" : "token exchange audience <some-audience> is invalid",
        "error" : "invalid_request"
    }
    ```

### Token Validation

If your app is a [resource server / API](concepts/actors.md#resource-server) and receives a token from another application, it is **your responsibility** to [validate the token](concepts/tokens.md#token-validation) intended for your application.

Configure your app with the [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata](concepts/actors.md#well-known-url-metadata-document) from the [well-known endpoint](tokenx.md#token_x_well_known_url). 
This contains the [issuer name](concepts/actors.md#issuer) and [JWKS endpoint](concepts/actors.md#jwks-endpoint-public-keys) containing the authorization server's [public keys](concepts/cryptography.md#public-keys).

#### Signature Verification

* The token should be signed with the `RS256` algorithm \(defined in JWT header\). Tokens not matching this algorithm should be rejected.
* Verify that the signature is correct.
  * The issuer's signing keys can be retrieved from the JWK Set \(JWKS\) at the `jwks_uri`.
  * The `kid` attribute in the token header is thus a reference to a key contained within the JWK Set.
  * The token signature should be verified against the public key in the matching JWK.

#### Claims

The following claims are by default provided in the issued token and should explicitly be validated:

* `iss` \(**issuer**\): The issuer of the token, the Tokendings issuer URI **must match exactly**.
* `aud` \(**audience**\): The intended audience for the token, **must match** your application's [client\_id](tokenx.md#token_x_client_id).
* `exp` \(**expiration time**\): Expiration time, i.e. tokens received after this date **must be rejected**.
* `nbf` \(**not before time**\): The token cannot be used before this time, i.e. if the token is issued in the "future" \(outside "reasonable" clock skew\) it **must be rejected**.
* `iat` \(**issued at time**\): The time at which the token has been issued. **Must be before `exp`**.
* `sub` \(**subject**\): If applicable, used in user centric access control. This represents a unique identifier for the user.

Other non-standard claims in the token are copied verbatim from the original token issued by `idp`.
For example, the claim used for the national identity number (_fødselsnummer_) for tokens issued by ID-porten is `pid`.

!!! warning "2023: New `acr` and `idp` values for ID-porten tokens"

    ID-porten has a new platform and architecture, which we will be required to migrate to by the end of 2023.

    The most substantial change is the **new values for the `acr` claim**.
    See the ["security levels" section in our ID-porten documentation](idporten.md#security-levels) for details.

    In order to ease migration, TokenX will automatically map the `acr` claim from new values to the old values for exchanged ID-porten tokens.
    This is however a **temporary** solution, which we will remove some time later in 2024 after the migration is complete.

    **If your application validates or otherwise uses the value found in the `acr` claim, you should ensure that both new and old values are accepted until the temporary mapping is removed.**

    The value in the `idp` claim for tokens from ID-porten will also change:

    | Old value                                           | New value                  |
