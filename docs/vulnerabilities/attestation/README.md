# Attestation with Docker Build Push

NAIS provides a GitHub Action for building and pushing Docker images to the [Google Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs).
The action automatically generates a signed attestation, including a [SBOM](../explanations/README.md#software-bill-of-materials) (Software Bill of Materials) for your container image and its dependencies.
This SBOM is uploaded to your container registry along with your image.  
The attestation is generated by the [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-action) and signed using [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign).
