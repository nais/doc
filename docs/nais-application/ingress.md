# Ingress parameters

You can tweak the Ingress configuration by specifying certain Kubernetes annotations in your app spec.
A list of supported variables are specified in the
[Nginx ingress documentation](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations/).

As the Nginx ingress documentation states, these parameters are set on the Ingress object.
However, Naiserator will copy these parameters from your Application spec.

## Custom max body size

For nginx, an `413` error will be returned to the client when the size in a request exceeds the maximum allowed size of the client request body.

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: 8m
```

## Custom proxy buffer size

Sets the size of the buffer proxy_buffer_size used for reading the first part of the response received from the proxied server. By default proxy buffer size is set as `4k`

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-buffer-size: "8k"
```

## Custom timeouts

In some scenarios is required to have different values for various timeouts. To allow this we provide parameters that allows this customization:
* `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-connect-timeout`
* `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-send-timeout`
* `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-read-timeout`
* `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-next-upstream`
* `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-next-upstream-timeout`
* `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-next-upstream-tries`
* `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-request-buffering`

Note: All timeout values are unitless and in seconds e.g. `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-read-timeout: "120"` sets a valid 120 seconds proxy read timeout.

## WebSockets Support

Support for websockets is provided by nginx ingress controller out of the box. No special configuration required.

The only requirement to avoid the close of connections is the increase of the values of `proxy-read-timeout` and `proxy-send-timeout`.

The default value of this settings is `60 seconds`.

A more adequate value to support websockets is a value higher than one hour (`3600`).

```yaml
apiVersion: nais.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: myapplication
  namespace: myteam
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-read-timeout: "600"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-send-timeout: "600"
spec:
  ...
```

## Ingress access logs

Request access logs from nginx ingress controller are automatically collected and stored in Kibana.

Here are pre-configured queries for the controller logs in the following clusters:

* [dev-gcp](https://logs.adeo.no/goto/82988ce0-3396-11ed-b3e8-d969437dd878)
* [prod-gcp](https://logs.adeo.no/goto/8ac4d5e0-3396-11ed-b3e8-d969437dd878)
* [dev-fss](https://logs.adeo.no/goto/97748420-3396-11ed-b3e8-d969437dd878)
* [prod-fss](https://logs.adeo.no/goto/a2b58730-3396-11ed-b3e8-d969437dd878)

### Log fields description

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `message` | HTTP request on the following format: "`method` `path` `httpVersion`" |
| `response_code` | HTTP response code from nginx |
| `x_upstream_name` | The application receiving the request on the following format "`namespace`-`app-name`-`port`"
| `x_upstream_status` | HTTP response code from the application |

### Fid _your_ access logs

In order to find your team's application access logs, you need to filter on the following fields:

* `AND x_upstream_name: my-namespace*` (replace `my-namespace` with your namespace)

If you want to filter on a specific application, you can add the following filter:

* `AND x_upstream_name: my-namespace-my-app*` (replace `my-namespace` with your namespace and `my-app` with your application name)

If you want to filter out specific HTTP response codes, you can add the following filter:

* `NOT response_code: 404` (replace `404` with the HTTP response code you want to filter out)

If you want to filter out multiple HTTP response codes, you can add the following filter:

* `NOT response_code: (404 or 503)` (replace `404` and `503` with the HTTP response codes you want to filter out)

If you want to find specific HTTP methods, you can add the following filter:

* `AND message: GET*` (replace `GET` with the HTTP method you want to filter out)

### Some debugging tips

If `response_code` and `x_upstream_status` are the same it means that the application returned this response code â€“ not nginx. Look in the logs for the corresponding application, this is not a problem with nginx.

Here are some suggestions depending on what http status code you might recieve from nginx:

| Code | Suggestion |
|------|------------|
| `400 Bad Request` | If nginx returns `401` error with no further explanation and there is no `x_upstream_name` it means that nginx received an invalid request before it could be sent to the backend. One of the most common problems is duplicate `Authorization` headers. |
| `413 Request Entity Too Large` | If nginx return `413` error it means that the request body is too large. This can be caused by a large file upload or a large request body. The solution is to add the `proxy-body-size` ingress parameter to an appropriate size. |
| `502 Bad Gateway` | If nginx return `502` error but the application is returning a `2xx` status code it might be caused by large response headers often cookies. The solution is the add the `proxy-buffer-size` to an appropriate size. |
