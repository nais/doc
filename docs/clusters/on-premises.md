# On-premises

The on-premise Kubernetes clusters are split across two zones and two environments:

| cluster        | zone                | environment |
|:---------------|:--------------------|:------------|
| `dev-fss`      | fagsystemsonen      | development |
| `prod-fss`     | fagsystemsonen      | production  |

## Accessing the application

Access is controlled in part by ingresses, which define where your application will be exposed as a HTTP endpoint. You can control where your application is reachable from by selecting the appropriate ingress domain.

!!! warning
    Make sure you understand where you expose your application, taking into account the state of your application, what kind of data it exposes and how it is secured. If in doubt, ask in \#nais or someone on the NAIS team.


You can control from where you application is reachable by selecting the appropriate ingress domain.
