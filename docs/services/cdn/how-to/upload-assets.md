# Upload assets to the CDN

This how-to guide shows you how to upload assets to the [CDN](../README.md).

## Prerequisites

- A [NAIS team](../../../explanations/team.md).
- A GitHub repository that the team has access to.
- The repository needs to have a [GitHub workflow](../../../build/README.md) that builds the assets you want to upload.

## Authorize repository for upload

1. Open [NAIS console](https://console.<<tenant()>>.cloud.nais.io) in your browser and select your team.
2. Select the `Repositories` tab
3. Find the repository you want to deploy from, and click `Authorize`

## Upload assets with the CDN action

{% if tenant() == "nav" %}
???+ note "SPA deploy"
    We also provide an action for swift deployment of single page applications (SPA),
    [spa-deploy](https://github.com/navikt/frontend/blob/main/actions/spa-deploy/README.md).
{% endif %}

In your Github Workflow, add the following step to upload your assets to the CDN.


```yaml
name: 'push-to-cdn'

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'main'

jobs:
  upload:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    permissions:
      contents: 'read'
      id-token: 'write'

    steps:
      - uses: 'actions/checkout@v4'

      - name: Upload static files to CDN
        uses: nais/deploy/actions/cdn-upload/v2@master
        with:
          team: <team slug> # Required, e.g. "team-name"
{%- if tenant() != "nav" %}
          tenant: <<tenant()>> # Required, e.g. "nav"
{%- endif %}
          source: <The path to your build folder or assets>
          destination: <A destination you pick, like /my-app/dist>
          # project_id and identity_provider must be included, and they
          # are provided as organization secret/variables.
          project_id: ${{ vars.NAIS_MANAGEMENT_PROJECT_ID }}
          identity_provider: ${{ secrets.NAIS_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER }}
  
      - run: echo uploaded file ${{ steps.upload.outputs.uploaded }}
        shell: bash
```

For more information on the inputs and outputs of the action, see the [CDN Reference](../reference/README.md).

## Use the uploaded assets

The assets from the CDN will be available at 

{% if tenant() == "nav" %}
```
https://cdn.nav.no/<team>/<destination>
```

and

```
https://cdn.<<tenant()>>.cloud.nais.io/<team>/<destination>
```
{% else %}
```
https://cdn.<<tenant()>>.cloud.nais.io/<team>/<destination>
```
{% endif %}

CORS is automatically configured to accept `GET` from any
origin (*).
