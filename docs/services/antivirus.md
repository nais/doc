# Anti-Virus Scanning

## Getting started

[ClamAV][clamav] is an open source antivirus engine for detecting trojans, viruses, malware and other malicious threats. It is used in a variety of situations including file scanning, email scanning, web scanning and end point security.

This feature is installed on all nais clusters. clamAV runs in its own pod with a separate pod running the REST api applications use. There is a service set up so all applications will be able to talk to the REST api using [http://clamav.nais-system.svc.nais.local/scan](http://clamav.nais-system.svc.nais.local/scan). The REST api supports PUT or POST and can be tested using curl as well:

ClamAV has a REST API applications can use for scanning files and urls.

The REST API has one endpoint `/scan` that supports PUT or POST with form-data. It can be tested using curl as well:

```bash
# Example
curl -v -X POST -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F "file1=@/tmp/file_to_test"  http://clamav.nais-system.svc.cluster.local/scan
curl -v -X PUT --data-binary @/tmp/file_to_test  http://clamav.nais-system.svc.nais.local/scan
curl -v http://clamav.nais-system.svc.cluster.local/scan?url=url_to_file
```

See [ClamAV documentation][clamav-docs] and [ClamAV REST API][clamav-api] for more information.

## Access Policy

When using ClamAV on GCP, remember to add an [outbound access policy](../workloads/how-to/access-policies.md):

```yaml
apiVersion: "nais.io/v1alpha1"
kind: "Application"
metadata:
  name: myapp
...
spec:
  ...
  accessPolicy:
    outbound:
      rules:
        - application: clamav
          namespace: nais-system
```

## Support
