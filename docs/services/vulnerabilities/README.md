# Vulnerability insights and management

Nais provides what you need to secure your software supply chain and manage vulnerabilities in your workloads.

Get started by using our [GitHub Actions](how-to/sbom.md) to generate SBOMs and attestations for your workloads.

Once this is in place, you can use the [Nais Console](../../operate/console.md) to view and manage vulnerabilities in your workloads.
