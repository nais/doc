# Access from laptop

This guide will take you through the required tools and permissions that need to be in place for you to be able to operate your own NAIS application directly from your laptop.

## Set up a team

The primary unit of access is a _team_, whose origin is a group in Azure AD.
Each team is given its own namespace with the same name as the team.
The team will have unrestricted access to all Kubernetes assets in that namespace.

See [creating a new team](teams.md#creating-a-new-team) to get started with teams.
After creating a new team, you should have access to all clusters.

!!! info "You're probably part of an existing team"
    If this is your first time here, chances are that you're already part of a team in the context of NAIS.
    There is currently no simple way to verify this, though you can look through [the AAD-groups that you are part of](https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/r#/groups) and see if there's any overlap with [navikt/teams](https://github.com/navikt/teams/blob/main/teams.md).

## Install [naisdevice](../device/README.md)

naisdevice ensures that your laptop meets NAVs requirements before allowing access to internal resources such as our NAIS clusters. 
Install by following the [naisdevice installation guide](../device/install.md).

## Install [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl)

`kubectl` is a command-line tool used to manage your Kubernetes resources.

Check out [`kubectlÂ´s` official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl) for instructions on how to install the binaries.

Remember that `kubectl` is supported within one minor version (older or newer) of `kube-apiserver`.
This is called [`version skew`](https://kubernetes.io/releases/version-skew-policy/#kubectl). 
[On-prem version is shown in Grafana - clusters](https://grafana.nais.io/d/NOlZDT7nk/clusters).

Using `brew` to manage `kubectl` will make it troublesome to be within the version skew, as it's hard to downgrade `kubectl` to older versions.
Therefor we recommend installing `kubectl` manually, or through tools like [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/).

## Setup your [`kubeconfig`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/)

The `kubectl` tool uses a `kubeconfig` file to get the information it needs in order to connect to a cluster.
We provide a [pre-made kubeconfig file](https://github.com/navikt/kubeconfigs) with NAV's clusters.

!!! info
    If you use `utviklerimage` or connect to NAV through BigIP VPN you need to use the kubeconfig under the Git tag `utviklerimage`. Go to the directory where you cloned kubeconfig and run

    ```bash
    git fetch --all --tags --prune
    git checkout tags/utviklerimage
    ```

`kubectl` will by default look for a file named `config` in the `$HOME/.kube/` folder. This can be overriden by having the absolute path of the file in the environment variable `KUBECONFIG`.

```bash
export KUBECONFIG="<path to your navikt/kubeconfigs repo>/config"
```

The above example can also be added to something like `~/.bash_profile`, or the equivalent in your preferred shell.

!!! warning
    If you use cygwin, you need the `KUBECONFIG` to be in Windows style paths rather than unix style paths \(e.g. `C:\dev\kubeconfigs\config` instead of `/cygdrive/c/dev/kubeconfigs/config`\)

## Authenticate `kubectl`

### Google Cloud Platform \(GCP\)

Before following these steps, [make sure your team is enabled for Google Cloud Platform](teams.md).

You will also need to perform a self-service step to synchronize your user from Azure AD to Google Cloud Platform. This can be done by following these steps:

1. [Login to My Apps > Add Application](https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/r#/addApplications)
3. Locate "Google Cloud Platform", and click on the icon

After you have done this your user will be synced to Google Cloud Platform. The sync is not instantaneous, but usually does not take more than a few minutes.

First you need to [install `gcloud`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) following the instructions for your platform.

Once installed, you need to authenticate with Google using your NAV e-mail.

```bash
$ gcloud auth login
```

Make sure you are connected to the right cluster, and verify that it works.

```bash
$ kubectl config use-context prod-gcp
Switched to context "prod-gcp".
$ kubectl cluster-info
gcp-terraform $ k cluster-info
Kubernetes master is running at https://127.0.0.1:14131
...
```

### On-premise

When connecting to on-premise clusters, you need to authenticate with Azure AD.

```bash
$ kubectl config use-context prod-fss
Switched to context "prod-fss".

$ kubectl get pods
To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://microsoft.com/devicelogin and enter the code CR69DPQQZ to authenticate.
```

When prompted like above, go to the address and enter the code. You then log in with your NAV e-mail and password. When done, `kubectl` will update your `kubeconfig`-file with the tokens needed to gain access to the cluster.
