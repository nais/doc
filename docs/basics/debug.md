# Debugging

## Debug `kubectl`

Ephemeral container is a temporary container that can be added to an existing pod to perform a specific task, such as debugging, monitoring, or troubleshooting.
Unlike regular containers, ephemeral containers do not persist beyond their immediate use, and they are not part of the podâ€™s desired state.
Therefore, ephemeral containers can be used for debugging and monitoring when a pod is live in a cluster, without changing the pod spec or restarting its pod.
Ephemeral container is also useful when using security hardened images, such as with [distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless) or [chainguard](https://github.com/chainguard-images/images#chainguard-images).

To run an ephemeral container in a pod, use the `kubectl debug` command.
The following example starts a shell in a new ephemeral container named `my-pod-name-debug` in the `my-pod-name` pod:

```bash
$ kubectl debug -it my-pod-name --image="cgr.dev/chainguard/busybox:latest" --profile=restricted -- sh
```

The `--profile=restricted` flag is required to run the Ephemeral debug container as a non-root user and without any capabilities.
Supported images are listed in [debug images list](https://github.com/nais/helm-charts/blob/35957de55ce6538993b22ec979d70c8cba519599/charts/kyverno-policies/values.yaml#L295).

!!! info
The -i flag causes kubectl debug to attach to the container by default.
You can prevent this by specifying --attach=false.
If your session becomes disconnected you can reattach using `kubectl attach`

Don't forget to clean up after yourself:

```bash
$ kubectl delete po my-pod-name
```

You can read more about the `kubectl debug` [command](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/debug-running-pod/#ephemeral-container).

The support for ephemeral debug containers also gives your team ability to take advantage of distroless and other security hardened images.
This is a great way to reduce the attack surface of your application and improve security.
