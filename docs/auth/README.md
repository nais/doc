# Authentication and authorization

{%- if tenant() == "nav" %}

Nais helps your applications [log in users](#logging-in-users), [validate inbound requests](#validating-inbound-requests) and [make authenticated outbound requests](#making-outbound-requests) using the following identity providers:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- [**Entra ID**][Entra ID] (aka Azure AD)

    For employees and internal services.

- [**ID-porten**][ID-porten]

    For Norwegian citizens.

- [**TokenX**][TokenX]

    For internal applications acting on-behalf-of ID-porten citizens.

- [**Maskinporten**][Maskinporten]

    For machine-to-machine communication between organizations or businesses.

</div>

Your application may have multiple use cases that can require a combination of services.

:books: To learn more about authentication and authorization in general, see [the explanations page](explanations/README.md).
If you just want to get started, continue reading below.

See the different scenarios below to identify which service(s) you need for your application, and follow the links to the respective service for more details.

## Logging in users

Depending on who your users are, you can use the following services to log them in:

:person_standing: Log in _employees_ :octicons-arrow-right-24: [Entra ID]

:person_standing: Log in _citizens_ :octicons-arrow-right-24: [ID-porten]

## Validating inbound requests

...from applications acting 

```mermaid
graph TD
  B1[on-behalf-of]
  B2[as themselves]

  B1 --> |citizens| TokenX[<a href='tokenx'>TokenX</>]
  B1 --> |employees| AAD_machine[<a href='entra-id'>Entra ID</>]
    
  
  B2 --> |internally| AAD_machine[<a href='entra-id'>Entra ID</>]
  B2 --> |externally| Maskinporten[<a href='maskinporten'>Maskinporten</a>]
```

The graph above can also be described as:

:material-server::person_standing: Validate requests from _internal_ application acting on behalf of _employee_ :octicons-arrow-right-24: [Entra ID]

:material-server::person_standing: Validate requests from _internal_ application acting on behalf of _citizen_:octicons-arrow-right-24: [TokenX]

:material-server: Validate requests from _internal_ application :octicons-arrow-right-24: [Entra ID]

:material-server: Validate requests from _external_ application :octicons-arrow-right-24: [Maskinporten]

## Making outbound requests

```mermaid
graph TD
  B1[on-behalf-of]
  B2[as application]

  B1 --> |citizens| TokenX[<a href='tokenx'>TokenX</>]
  B1 --> |employees| AAD_machine[<a href='entra-id'>Entra ID</>]
  
  B2 --> |internally| AAD_machine[<a href='entra-id'>Entra ID</>]
  B2 --> |externally| Maskinporten[<a href='maskinporten'>Maskinporten</a>]
```

The graph above can also be described as:

:material-server::person_standing: Make requests to _internal_ API on behalf of _employee_ :octicons-arrow-right-24: [Entra ID]

:material-server::person_standing: Make requests to _internal_ API on behalf of _citizen_ :octicons-arrow-right-24: [TokenX]

:material-server: Make requests to _internal_ API :octicons-arrow-right-24: [Entra ID]

:material-server: Make requests to _external_ API :octicons-arrow-right-24: [Maskinporten]
