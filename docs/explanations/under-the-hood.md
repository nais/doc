# Under the hood

In this explanation, we will go through some of the underlying technologies we use to provide NAIS.

## Environment

### Runtime implementation

Each _environment_ is its own [Kubernetes :octicons-link-external-16:](https://kubernetes.io) cluster using [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) :octicons-link-external-16:](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine?hl=en).

Inside each environment, every team has their own [namespace :octicons-link-external-16:](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/).

A namespace can contain one or more [workloads](../workloads/README.md).
Only members of the team have access to the namespace and its resources.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph env-dev[dev environment]
        subgraph ns-dev[team namespace]
          app[App]
          job[Job]
        end
    end
```

In the example above, the team has an application and a job running in the `dev` environment.

### Workload isolation

All workloads are deployed in a team namespace.

Every workload is isolated from _all_ other workloads with [Kubernetes network policies :octicons-link-external-16:](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/).

Access is denied by default, unless [explicitly allowed](../workloads/explanations/zero-trust.md).

## Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resources

Each team has a dedicated [GCP project :octicons-link-external-16:](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects) for _each_ environment.

When your workload requests resources e.g. a bucket, it will be provisioned in the team's project for the matching environment.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph env-dev["dev environment"]
        subgraph ns-dev[team namespace]
          app-dev[App]
        end
    end

    subgraph project-dev[team project dev]
        bucket-dev[Bucket]
    end

    subgraph env-prod["prod environment"]
        subgraph ns-prod[team namespace]
            app-prod[App]
        end
    end

    subgraph project-prod[team project prod]
        bucket-prod[Bucket]
    end

app-dev--> bucket-dev
app-prod--> bucket-prod
```

In the example above, the team has an application running in the `dev` environment.
When the application requests a bucket, it is provisioned in the team's `dev` project.

Equivalently for the `prod` environment, the bucket is provisioned in the team's `prod` project.
