# Tracing data in Elastic APM

!!! warning "Deprecation notice"

    Support for Elastic APM in Nais has been deprecated and will be removed at the end of the year.

For nais applications running on-prem (dev-fss and prod-fss) you have the option to send telemetry data to Elastic APM in adition to Grafana. This guide will help you get started with Elastic APM for your application.

## Enable auto-instrumentation for Elastic APM

Elastic APM can be enabled by setting the list of auto-instrumentation destinations in your nais application manifest.

```yaml hl_lines="7-8"
spec:
  observability:
    autoInstrumentation:
      enabled: true
      runtime: "java"
      destinations:
        - id: "elastic-apm"
```

It is possible to send data to multiple destinations (such as `grafana-lgtm`) by adding more destinations to the list.

### Service Environment

If you have multiple virutal environments for your application such ac `q1`, `t2`, or `p`, you can specify the environment in the `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` environment variable.

```yaml
spec:
  env:
    - name: OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES
      value: "deployment.environment.name=q1"
```

## Accessing the Elastic APM UI

The Elastic APM UI is available at [logs.adeo.no](https://logs.adeo.no/app/apm/services) and requires you to log in with your NAV account and by selecting the `APM` menu item.

From there you can select the application (or service as they are called in Elastic APM) you want to inspect.
