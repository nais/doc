# Alerts

We use [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) to collect metrics, and can trigger alerts based on these metrics.
Alerts are specified in their own Kubernetes resource called `alerts` as we have made our own operator called [Alerterator](https://github.com/nais/alerterator).

## Getting started

To get started using Alerts we need to have a yaml-file describing our rules.
You can start of with our [recommended alerts](recommended_alerts.md) (made by contributions from our users!).

Usually it's simplest to just call this file `alerts.yaml`, which we will do in this example.
You can see the content of the file below, and you will see that we only notify Slack, but you can add more receivers.

```yaml
apiVersion: "nais.io/v1"
kind: "Alert"
metadata:
  name: nais-testapp
  namespace: aura
  labels:
    team: aura
spec:
  receivers: # receivers for all alerts below
    slack:
      channel: '#nais-alerts-dev'
      prependText: '<!here> | ' # this text will be prepended to the Slack alert title
  alerts:
    - alert: Nais-testapp unavailable
      expr: 'kube_deployment_status_replicas_unavailable{deployment="nais-testapp"} > 0'
      for: 2m
      action: Read app logs(kubectl logs appname). Read Application events (kubectl descibe deployment appname)
      description: The app might crash sometimes due to startup errors
      documentation: https://github.com/navikt/aura-doc/naisvakt/alerts.md#app_unavailable
      sla: respond within 1h, during office hours
      severity: danger
    - alert: CoreDNS unavailable
      description: CoreDNS unavailable, there are zero replicas
      expr: 'kube_deployment_status_replicas_available{namespace="kube-system", deployment="coredns"} == 0'
      for: 1m
      action: kubectl describe pod -l app=nais-testapp
      documentation: https://github.com/navikt/aura-doc/naisvakt/alerts.md#coredns
      sla: respond within 1h, solve within 4h, around the clock
      severity: danger
```

### Deployment

If you already use `nais/deploy`, adding a new deploy-action is rather simple. Create a file called `.github/workflows/alert-deploy.yaml`

```yaml
name: Deploy alerts to NAIS
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - 'alerts.yaml'
      - '.github/workflows/alerts.yaml'
jobs:
  apply-alerts:
    name: Apply alerts to cluster
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: deploy to dev
        uses: nais/deploy/actions/deploy@v1
        env:
          APIKEY: ${{ secrets.NAIS_DEPLOY_APIKEY }}
          CLUSTER: dev-fss
          RESOURCE: /path/to/alerts.yaml
      - name: deploy to prod
        uses: nais/deploy/actions/deploy@v1
        env:
          APIKEY: ${{ secrets.NAIS_DEPLOY_APIKEY }}
          CLUSTER: prod-fss
          RESOURCE: /path/to/alerts.yaml
```

You can also add `/path/to/alerts.yaml` to `RESOURCE` in a previous workflow, just remember to [escape your expressive descriptions.](../../deployment/#escaping-and-raw-resources) 

## Different receivers/notifications

Alerterator supports three different types of notification, [Slack](reference.md#receiversslack), [E-mail](reference.md#receiversemail), and [SMS](reference.md#receiverssms).
In our spec we follow the naming convention of Alertmanager and call it `receivers`.

Take a look below too see exactly how each receiver is configured.

### Slack

```text
spec:
  receivers:
    slack:
      channel: '#teamname-alerts'
      prependText: '<!here>'
```

Slack will always notify you when an alert is resolved.

### E-mail

```text
spec:
  receivers:
    email:
      to: 'kari.nordmann@nav.no'
      send_resolved: 'true'
```

`send_resolved` can be set to `true` if you want to receiver notification for when an alert is resolved.

### SMS

```text
spec:
  receivers:
    sms:
      recipients: '12345678,8764321'
      send_resolved: 'false'
```

`send_resolved` can be set to `true` if you want to receiver notification for when an alert is resolved.

## How to write a good alert

### Writing the `expr`

In order to minimize the feedback loop we suggest experimenting on the Prometheus server to find the right metric for your alert and the notification threshold.
The Prometheus server can be found in each cluster, at `https://prometheus.{cluster.ingress}` (i.e. [https://prometheus.dev-gcp.nais.io](https://prometheus.dev-gcp.nais.io)).

You can also visit the Alertmanager at `https://alertmanager.{cluster.ingress}` (i.e. [https://alertmanager.dev-gcp.nais.io](https://alertmanager.dev-gcp.nais.io)) to see which alerts are triggered now (you can also silence already triggered alerts).

### Expressive descriptions or actions

You can also use `labels` in your notification by referencing them with `{{ $labels.<field> }}`. 

For example:

```text
{{ $labels.node }} is marked as unschedulable
```

turns into the following when notifying:

```text
b27apvl00178.preprod.local is marked as unschedulable
```

Note that the query decides which labels are available, since the labels correnspond to the field names in the document that is the query result. To see which labels are available for your specific query, run your query on the Prometheus server. Here's an [example](https://prometheus.dev-fss.nais.io/graph?g0.expr=kube_deployment_status_replicas_available%20%3D%3D%200&g0.tab=1&g0.stacked=0&g0.show_exemplars=0&g0.range_input=1h) (remember to connect your naisdeveice).

You can read more about this over at the [Prometheus documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/#templating) and at the [Kubernetes documentation of exposed metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/tree/master/docs).

#### Labels and nais/deploy

If you are using labels and variables with nais/deploy, you need to remember to escape the labels used for the alerts.
See [deployment\#escaping-and-raw-resources](https://doc.nais.io/deployment#escaping-and-raw-resources) for how.

#### Value of expression
You can get the value of your expression with `$value`

### Target several apps or namespaces in a query

Using regular expression, you can target multiple apps or namespaces with one query.
This saves on repeating the same alert for each your apps.

```text
absent(up{app=~"myapp|otherapp|thirdapp"})
```

Here we use `=~` to select labels that match the provided string (or substring) using a regular expression. Use `!~` to negate the regular expression.

When doing this, it can be smart to use labels (mention above), to list which namespace the alert is tied to.
Use the `kubernetes_namespace` label in your `action` or `description` by adding `{{ $labels.kubernetes_namespace }}`, and it will write the namespace for the app that is having problems.

## Slack

### Notify @here and @team

Slack has their own syntax for notifying `@channel` or `@here`, respectively `<!channel>` and `<!here>`.

Notifying a user group on the other hand is a bit more complicated.
The user group `@nais-vakt` is written `<!subteam^SB8KS4WAV|nais-vakt>` in a Slack alert message, where `SB8KS4WAV` is the id for the specific user group, and `nais-vakt` is the name of the user group.

You can find the id by right clicking on the name in the user group list.
Where last part in the URL is the id. The URL will look something like the one below:

```text
https://nav-it.slack.com/usergroups/SB8KS4WAV
```

### Examples of the different Slack/severity colors

Slack alerts supports colors.
The severity field defines the color (`good` is results in a green message, `warning` in a yellow and `danger` in a red).
If you want to define another color, specify the wanted hex code as severity instead of the pre-defined words.
