# Metrics

Prometheus is used to scrape metrics from the pod. You have to add Prometheus in your [NAIS manifest](../nais-application/application.md) to enable scrape.

Each app that have scraping enabled can use the default Grafana dashboard [nais-app-dashboard](https://grafana.nais.io/d/000000283/nais-app-dashbord), or create theire own.

## NAIS manifest config

```text
spec:
  prometheus:
    enabled: true  # default: false. Pod will now be scraped for metrics by Prometheus.
    path: /metrics # Path where prometheus metrics are served.
```

### JVM Application

If you are building an app on the JVM you can use Prometheus' own [Java client library](https://github.com/prometheus/client_java). Make sure to enable scraping in the NAIS manifest.

We also recommend to export the default metrics.

```text
DefaultExports.initialize();
```

## Retention

When using Prometheus the retention is 16 weeks for prod, and 4 weeks for dev.
If you need data stored longer then what Prometheus support, we recommend using your own [Aiven Influxdb](/persistence/influxdb).
Then you have full control of the database and retention.

Data via [push metrics/sensu](#push-metrics) is stored for one year.

## Push metrics

If you don't want to just rely on pull metrics, you can push data directly to InfluxDB via [Sensu](https://sensu.io/).

This is easily done by writing to the Sensu socket.

```text
sensu.nais:3030
```

Example message:

```javascript
{
  "name": "myapp_metrics",
  "type": "metric",
  "handlers": ["events_nano"],
  "output": "myapp.event1,tag1=x,tag2=y value=1,value2=2 1571402276000000000\nmyapp.event2,tag1=xx,tag2=yy value=42,value2=69 1571402276000000000"
}
```

The format of the data \(The `output` field in the message\) should be formatted as [Influxdb Line Protocol](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.5/write_protocols/line_protocol_tutorial/#syntax).

!!! warning
    Note that each variation of tag values will create a new time series, so avoid using tags for data that varies a lot. Read more about best practices here: [InfluxDB schema design and data layout](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/concepts/schema_and_data_layout/)
