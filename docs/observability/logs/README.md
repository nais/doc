# Logs

## Logging

Configure your application to log to console \(stdout/stderr\), it will be scraped by [FluentD](https://www.fluentd.org/) running inside the cluster and sent to [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) and made available via [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana). Visit our Kibana at [logs.adeo.no](https://logs.adeo.no/).

If you want more information than just the log message \(loglevel, MDC, etc\), you should log in JSON format; the fields you provide will then be indexed.

## Gain access to logs.adeo.no

In order to get access to logs.adeo.no you need to have the correct access rights added to your AD account. This can be requested through your Personnal Manager.

These permissions will give you access:
```
0000-GA-Logganalyse
0000-GA-Logganalyse_FullVerdikjede_Prod
0000-GA-Logganalyse_FullVerdikjede_UTQ
```

If you're unsure if you already have these permission, or some of them, you can check what permission you currently have at igruppe.adeo.no

## Secure logs

Some applications have logs with information that should not be stored with the normal application logs. To support this a directory for these logs can be mounted in the application, and the content of logs written here will be transferred to separate indices in Elasticsearch.

### Enabling secure logs

Secure logs can be enabled by setting the `secureLogs.enabled` flag in the application resource. See [the nais manifest specification](../../nais-application/application.md).

### Log files

With secure logs enabled a directory `/secure-logs/` will be mounted in the application container. Every `*.log` file in this directory will be monitored and the content transferred to Elasticsearch. Make sure that these files are readable for the log shipper \(the process runs as uid/gid 1065\).

The `/secure-logs/` directory has a size limit of 128Mb, and it's the application responsibility to ensure that this limit is not exceeded. **If the limit is exceeded the application pod will be evicted and restarted.** Use log rotation on file size to avoid this.

### Log configuration

Log files should be in JSON format as the normal application logs. Here is an example configuration of JSON logging with a size based rolling file appender in Logback:

```markup
  <appender name="secureLog" class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender">
    <file>/secure-logs/secure.log</file>
    <rollingPolicy class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.FixedWindowRollingPolicy">
      <fileNamePattern>/secure-logs/secure.log.%i</fileNamePattern>
      <minIndex>1</minIndex>
      <maxIndex>1</maxIndex>
    </rollingPolicy>
    <triggeringPolicy class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.SizeBasedTriggeringPolicy">
      <maxFileSize>50MB</maxFileSize>
    </triggeringPolicy>
    <encoder class="net.logstash.logback.encoder.LogstashEncoder" />
  </appender>
```

See [logging examples](examples.md) for more information on log configuration.

### Non-JSON logs

If the logging framework used doesn't support JSON logging, it is also possible to use multiline logs in this format:

```text
<iso8601 timestamp> <log level> <message>
<message cont.>
<message cont.>
```

Files on this format must be named `*.mlog`.

### Sending logs with HTTP

If you do not want to have these logs as files in the pod, it is also possible to use HTTP to write logs. POST your log entry as JSON to `http://localhost:19880`

```bash
curl -X POST -d '{"log":"hello world","field1":"value1"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost:19880/
```

## Audit logs

Most applications where a user processes data related to another user need to log audit statements, detailing which user did what action on which subject.
These logs need to follow a specific format and be accessible by ArcSight.
See [naudit](https://github.com/navikt/naudit) for how to set up the logging, and details on the log format. 

## Overview

## Gaining access in kibana

Once everything is configured, your secure logs will be sent to the `tjenestekall-*` index in kibana. To gain access to these logs, you need to do the following:

### 1 Create an AD-group

To make sure you gain access to the proper logs, you need an AD-group connected to the nais-team. So the first thing you do is create this group.

Go to [Porten (service desk)](https://jira.adeo.no/plugins/servlet/desk/portal/542) and click `Melde sak til IT`. The follow the template below.
For IT to be able to correctly add the group to Remedy you need to specify the four digit department code for those who can be able to ask for permission to the group. E.g 2990 is the four digit code for the department IT-AVDELINGEN. If you are creating secure logs for your team and are unsure about which department your colleagues belong to then you can use [Delve](https://eur.delve.office.com/) to search for their profile. In their profile their department code will also be visible.

You can paste the template below into Jira:
```
Ønsker å få opprettet en AD-gruppe for å få tilgang til sikker logg i Kibana for applikasjoner knyttet til <your project here>.

Gruppenavn: 0000-GA-SECURE_LOG_<SOMETHING>

Beskrivelse: Tilgang til secureLog for Team <team name> i Kibana.

Kryss i identrutinen: Ja

Den må inn i Remedy.
Enheter i Nav som skal ha tilgang: <four digit department code>. E.g (2990 - IT-AVDELINGEN)
```

### 2 Connect the AD group to your team in Kibana

The logs your apps produces are linked with your [nais-team](../../basics/teams).
Administrators of Kibana will create a role for your team with read rights to those logs.
Whoever is in the AD-group (created in step 1) will get the Kibana role, and can thus read all logs produced by apps belonging to the nais-team.

Ask in the [#atom](https://nav-it.slack.com/archives/C7TQ25L9J) Slack channel to connect the AD-group (created in step 1) to your nais-team.

### 3 Put people into the AD-group

This must be done by "identansvarlig". For NAV-IT employees, this is `nav.it.identhandtering@nav.no`. Send them an email and ask for access with a CC to whoever is your superior.

For everyone else, the team lead or who ever is their superior should know.

### What can go wrong?

Basically, the one thing that can go wrong here is that the AD-group is not registered in "identrutinen". If this happens, the group cannot be found by "identansvarlig". If this happens, make a new JIRA-ticket to the same people and tell them to transfer the group. Sadly this can take a few days.
