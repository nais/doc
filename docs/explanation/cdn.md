# Content Delivery Network (CDN)

A content delivery network (CDN) is a service for serving static content and single-page applications (SPA).

NAIS offers CDN as a service through Google
Cloud CDN. The CDN is used for serving static content such as HTML
files, JavaScript libraries and files, stylesheets, and images.

Assets are deployed by uploading them to a bucket using a GitHub
action.
