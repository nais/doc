NetworkPolicy:

## 006 - Deny specific service types

This policy uses artifact provenance to identify how an artifact was produced
and from where it originated. SLSA provenance is an industry-standard
method of representing that provenance. This policy verifies that an
image has SLSA provenance and was signed by the expected subject and issuer
when produced through GitHub Actions. It requires configuration based upon
your own values.

### Message

The fields spec.ephemeralContainers[*].image requires to be set for allowed image
