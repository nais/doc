# NAISjobs

In terms of scheduled jobs/cronjobs on Kubernetes, NAISjobs is a slightly more hands-on approach compared to other
parts of NAIS.

## Team setup

This section describes various parts which may be required for your team to create NAISjobs. Some of these steps may
already have been done for your team.

### Vault setup

Have a look at the [Vault documentation for end users] if the team has jobs which requires secrets. Regarding
*"Give a NAIS application read access to Vault secret"*, it is important to note that cronjobs run in a *separate*
namespace!

### Separate namespace

NAIS only allows cronjobs in separate namespaces. Teams get their own namespace in which their jobs can run in, this is
configured in [navikt/nais-yaml]. If `jobs.yaml` does not exist in the cluster directory, it must be created.
Additionally, `naisjobs.yaml` must be copied from a cluster directory to an equivalent `templates/${cluster}`
directory.

#### Adding a team to github.com/navikt/nais-yaml/vars/${cluster}/jobs.yaml

The variables in the examples of this section are as follows
* `${namespace}` is the name of the namespace the team wants for their cronjobs
* `${teamname}` is the name of the team
* `${ldap_group_id}` is the object ID of the team's [Azure AD group]

##### Does jobs.yaml exist?

Add your team metadata to the bottom of the file

```yaml
- name: ${namespace}
  group_name: ${teamname}
  group_id: ${ldap_group_id}
```

##### Is there no jobs.yaml file?

Create a file named `jobs.yaml` in the directory with the following content.

```yaml
naisjobs:
- name: ${namespace}
  group_name: ${teamname}
  group_id: ${ldap_group_id}
```

### Machine user

While it is possible to create cronjobs as a regular user, it is also possible to get a [machine user] created if
the team requires to communicate with NAIS outside of Azure Active Directory. Ask in [#nais][nais slack channel] on Slack to create a
machine user. Please provide `cluster` and `team`.

## Applying a job to Kubernetes

When all the aforementioned steps have been completed, one can finally `apply` a yaml file to the cluster, either
through the use of a [machine user] or as a regular user!

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f job.yml
```

Below is an example of how such a yaml file may look.

* Note that `spec.jobTemplate.spec.template.spec.initContainers` and its children can be removed if there is no need
for Vault/secrets.

The variables in this example are as follows
* `${jobname}`: the name of the cronjob
* `${namespace}`: the name of the namespace, see [Separate namespace]
* `${teamname}`: the name of the team
* `${schedule}`: the job's schedule in a [cron time string format]
* `${vks_auth_path}`: is the cronjob's authentication path in Vault
* `${vks_kv_path}`: is the path to the cronjob's secret in the Vault `kv` engine
