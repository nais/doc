# IBM MQ

[IBM MQ][ibm-mq] IBM MQ supports the exchange of information between applications, systems, services and files by sending and receiving message data via messaging queues. This simplifies the creation and maintenance of business applications. IBM MQ works with a broad range of computing platforms, and can be deployed across a range of different environments including on-premise, in cloud, and hybrid cloud deployments. IBM MQ supports a number of different APIs including Message Queue Interface (MQI), Java Message Service (JMS), REST, .NET, IBM MQ Light and MQTT.
We recommend using kafka where possible and sensible [Kafka](./kafka/README.md) for all new applications

## Getting started

!!! info
    When ordering groups for existing service users the password will be reset. If you do not want the password to be reset, contact windows admin and ask them to add the existing user to the AD group and set the "extensionAttribute9" property on the user

MQ groups and users are ordered using [basta](https://basta.intern.nav.no).
For legacy applications registered in [fasit](https://fasit.adeo.no) use "AD groups" on the "Create" tab,
for all other applications use "Custom AD groups".

Access to basta (and fasit) can be obtained by requesting access from [identity management](mailto:nav.it.identhandtering@nav.no).

Access to development environments (including legacy u, t and q environments):

```
0000-GA-env-config-TestAdmin - Fasit T/Q
```

Access to production environments (including legacy p environment):

```
0000-GA-env-config-ProdAdmin - Fasit P
```

Order the group by using your applications name, the group name in AD will be 0000-GA-MQ- followed by the application name.
If no service account exists with the name srv + application name, it will be created and added to the group.
If the user already exists the user will be added to the group and the password will be updated
and uploaded to [vault](https://vault.adeo.no) in the serviceuser directory.

From vault you can then mount this secret into your pod to authenticate with MQ.

## Environments

We have three environments for MQ: `QA`, `TEST`, and `PROD`.

=== "TEST"

    | QueueManager   | Hostname                 | Port |
    | -------------- | ------------------------ | ---- |
    | MTLS01         | d26apvl298.test.local    | 1412 |
    | MTLS02         | d26apvl299.test.local    | 1412 |
    | MTLS03         | d26apvl300.test.local    | 1412 |
    | MTLS04         | d26apvl300.test.local    | 1412 |

=== "QA"

    | QueueManager   | Hostname                 | Port |
    | -------------- | ------------------------ | ---- |
    | MQLS01         | mqls01.preprod.local     | 1413 |
    | MQLS02         | mqls02.preprod.local     | 1413 |
    | MQLS03         | mqls03.preprod.local     | 1413 |
    | MQLS04         | mqls04.preprod.local     | 1413 |

=== "PROD"

For production environment there is a high availability solution in place that offers higher availability than the standard MQ solution.
Assumes that the app reconnects in the event of an error such as "connection broken".

    | QueueManager   | Hostname                 | Port |  
    | -------------- | ------------------------ | ---- |
    | MPLS01         | mpls01.adeo.no           | 1414 |
    | MPLS02         | mpls02.adeo.no           | 1414 |
    | MPLS03         | mpls03.adeo.no           | 1414 |
    | MPLS04         | mpls04.adeo.no           | 1414 |

 

These servers are available from on-premises and GCP alike.

## Application Configuration

The application needs to implement MQ authentication using the client libraries, as opposed to previously just sending username.

If you are using MQ client lower than 9.2.1.0 set this parameter when connecting:

```
USER_AUTHENTICATION_MQCSP=true
```

Setting this in java:

```
connectionFactory.setBooleanProperty(JmsConstants.USER_AUTHENTICATION_MQCSP, true);
```

### Transport Layer Security (TLS)
Setting this is recommended, so that the information is not send in plain text

Setting this in java:

```
connectionFactory.setSslSocketFactory(SSLSocketFactory.getDefault());
connectionFactory.setSslCipherSuite = "*TLS13ORHIGHER"
```

#### TLS for applications running on GCP

For applications running in GCP you need to use and create the TLS certificates manually, and MQ-Admins need to turn on TLS for the spesific MQ channel
Using the TLS certificates can be done by setting these environment variables:

* ``` "javax.net.ssl.keyStore" = $YOUR_MQ_TLS_KEYSTORE_PATH  ```
* ``` "javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword" = $YOUR_MQ_TLS_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD```
* ``` "javax.net.ssl.keyStoreType" = "jks" ```

##### Creating TLS certificates manually
First you need to create your application in [fasit](https://fasit.adeo.no), 
example app: https://fasit.adeo.no/applications/smtss
This is disabled, so you need some admins to do it for you. 
Ask if someone can create it for you in one of the following slack channels #nais or #atom
Then you need to order a certificate for that applications service user that you use to connect to MQ in [basta](https://basta.intern.nav.no)
