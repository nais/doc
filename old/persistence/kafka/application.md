# Application

!!! warning
    This feature applies only to _Aiven hosted Kafka_. On-premises Kafka is deprecated, and creating new topics on-premises was disabled summer 2021. For on-premises Kafka, see [on-premises Kafka documentation](https://confluence.adeo.no/display/AURA/Kafka).

## What happens on deploy?

When you deploy an application that requests access to Kafka, Naiserator will create an `AivenApplication` resource in the cluster.
The `AivenApplication` has a name that matches the deployed application, and the name of the secret to generate.
Naiserator will request that a secret with this name used in the deployment.

When an `AivenApplication` resource is created or updated, Aivenator will create a new service user and generate credentials.
These credentials are then inserted into the requested secret and used in the deployment.

If there is a problem generating the secret, this might fail your deployment.
In this case, Aivenator will update the `status` part of the resource, with further information about the problem.

## Testing your application

If you need to test that you have configured your consumer application correctly, you can use one of the kafkarator-canary topics.
All applications (from all teams) have read access to the canary topics.
All the canary topics receives a message on a fixed interval, containing a RFC3339 formatted timestamp.
The only difference between each, is where the producer is located.
The available canary topics are:

| Pool     | Topic name                              |
| :------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| nav-dev  | nais-verification.kafka-canary-dev-gcp  |
| nav-dev  | nais-verification.kafka-canary-dev-fss  |
| nav-prod | nais-verification.kafka-canary-prod-gcp |
| nav-prod | nais-verification.kafka-canary-prod-fss |

## Using Kafka Streams with internal topics

!!! info
    This feature is only available in GCP clusters.


In some configurations of kafka streams your application needs to create internal topics. To allow
your app to make internal topics, you need to set
[.spec.kafka.streams](../../nais-application/application.md#kafkastreams) to `true` in your application
spec (nais.yaml)

When you do this you **must** configure Kafka Streams by setting the property `application.id` to a value that starts
with the value of the env var `KAFKA_STREAMS_APPLICATION_ID`, which will be injected into your pod automatically.

## Accessing topics from an application on legacy infrastructure

If you have an application on legacy infrastructure (outside NAIS clusters), you can still access topics with a few more manual steps.

The first step is to add your application to the topic ACLs, the same way as for applications in NAIS clusters (see [the previous section](#accessing-topics-from-an-application)).
Use your team name, and a suitable name for the application, following NAIS naming conventions.

To create a credentials for your application, you need to manually create the `AivenApplication` resource that would normally be created by Naiserator.

=== "aivenapp.yaml"
    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: aiven.nais.io/v1
    kind: AivenApplication
    metadata:
      name: legacyapplication
      namespace: myteam
    spec:
      kafka:
        pool: nav-dev
      secretName: unique-name
      protected: true
    ```

Since Aivenator automatically deletes secrets that are not in use by any pod, you need to set the `protected` flag to `true`.
This ensures that the secret will not be deleted by any automated process.

After the `AivenApplication` resources has been created, Aivenator will create the secret, using the name specified.
The secretName must be a valid [DNS label](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#dns-label-names), and must be unique within the namespace.
Using `kubectl`, extract the secret and make the values available to your legacy application.

When you no longer have a need for the credentials created in this way, delete the `AivenApplication` resource, and make sure the secret is also deleted.

If you migrate the application to NAIS, the first deploy to NAIS will overwrite the `AivenApplication` resource.
When this happens, it is no longer `protected`.
In this case, it is recommended that you manually delete the protected secret when it is no longer needed.

## Application design guidelines

### Authentication and authorization

The NAIS platform will generate new credentials when your applications is deployed. Kafka requires TLS client certificates for authentication. Make sure your Kafka and/or TLS library can do client certificate authentication, and that you can specify a custom CA certificate for server validation.

### Readiness and liveness

Making proper use of liveness and readiness probes can help with many situations.
If producing or consuming Kafka messages are a vital part of your application, you should consider failing one or both probes if you have trouble with Kafka connectivity.
Depending on your application, failing liveness might be the proper course of action.
This will make sure your application is restarted when it is experiencing problems, which might help.

In other cases, failing just the readiness probe will allow your application to continue running, attempting to move forward without being killed.
Failing readiness will be most helpful during deployment, where the old instances will keep running until the new are ready.
If the new instances are not able to connect to Kafka, keeping the old ones until the problem is resolved will allow your application to continue working.
