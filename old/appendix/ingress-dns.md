# Ingress DNS setup

For most domains we point a wildcard DNS record to a loadbalancer in front of our ingress-controller.

Example:

`*.dev-gcp.nais.io -> 35.201.69.142`

This means that all entries under this domain, e.g. foo.dev-gcp.nais.io, will resolve to this address automatically.

## Shared domains

When domains are shared between clusters, such as `dev.intern.nav.no` which exists both in `dev-gcp` and `dev-fss`, we have a wildcard entry pointing to dev-gcp. 
In addition, to be able to use the same domain in `dev-fss`, we have to create explicit records in DNS to be able to direct the traffic to another cluster.

These records are automatically created based on the ingresses defined in the cluster.

!!! warning
    You cannot have a application using the same ingress in both clusters, as the explicit record created will always override the wildcard ingress.
