## Contact the NAIS team
The team can be found on [Slack](https://nav-it.slack.com/messages/C5KUST8N6/).

## On-call services
NAIS has a 24/7 on-call service for operation and troubleshooting of the on-premises and GCP platforms, as well as third-party suppliers Aiven.

During regular working hours, you can mention @nais-team on Slack.

The on-call service is to be used for production environment events outside regular working hours only.

The on-call service is rotated, the person on-call can be found in the Slack user group "nais-vakt".
The on-call phone number can be found in the header of the [NAIS Slack](https://nav-it.slack.com/archives/C5KUST8N6).

Response time for a request should be no more than 30 minutes for Slack mentions (@nais-vakt).

### Would your team like to work more closely with NAIS?
If your team would like closer follow-up for a period (or permanently), we would happily dedicate someone from NAIS as your NAM(s) - short for "NAIS Account Managers".
This means we will create a dedicated Slack channel for NAIS/team-communication and have meetings if required to discuss your concerns, issues, or wishes for the platform.
