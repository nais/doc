# Help!

Don't panic!

| Deployment status | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| success | Everything is fine, your application has been deployed, and is up and running. |
| queued | Deployment request accepted, waiting to be deployed. |
| in_progress | Application deployed to Kubernetes, waiting for new version to start. |
| failure | Your application failed to start. Check state with `kubectl describe app <APP>`. |
| error | Either an error in your request, or the deployment system has issues. Check the logs. |


## First debugging steps

When something is wrong with your application, these kubectl tools should be the first things you check out:

Describe the pod to find statuses and messages:

```
kubectl describe pod <podname>
```

And view the logs for your pods with this command:

```
kubectl logs <podname>
```


## Logs

All deployments are logged to Kibana. You can get a direct link to your deployment logs
from the `https://github.com/navikt/<YOUR_REPOSITORY>/deployments` page.
Click on the link that says _deployed_.

This link is also printed in the console output.
It looks like `https://deployment.prod-sbs.nais.io/logs?delivery_id=<UUID>&ts=<TIMESTAMP>`.
