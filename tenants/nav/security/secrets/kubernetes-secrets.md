# Kubernetes Secrets

!!! info "Integration with Google Cloud Platform"
    We also offer an optional integration with [_Google Secret Manager_](google-secrets-manager.md) as a simplified supplement to using Kubernetes Secrets directly. 

When running an application in a team namespace, [Kubernetes Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret) can be used directly.

To get started using this, simply [create the secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#creating-your-own-secrets). A secret can be either key-value pairs or files, and can be exposed to the application as environment variables or files.

Microsoft has a good [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmhM33j5WYk) video that explains the concepts of Kubernetes secrets.

## Example

Creating a secret

```bash
$ kubectl create secret generic my-secret --from-literal=key1=supersecret
secret/my-secret created
```

!!! info
    The kubectl plugin [kubectl-modify-secret](https://github.com/rajatjindal/kubectl-modify-secret) is recommended if you need to modify the secret contents after creation.

Exposing `my-secret` as environment variables to the application by referring to it in `nais.yaml`

```yaml
spec:
  envFrom:
    - secret: my-secret
```

That's it! When the application is running, the environment variable `key1` will have the value `supersecret`.

Alternatively, if the secret should have their contents mounted into the containers as files:

```yaml
spec:
  filesFrom:
    - secret: my-secret
```

The secret is then exposed under the path specified by `spec.filesFrom[].mountPath` \(default `/var/run/secrets`\). For this example it is available at `/var/run/secrets/key1`.
Note that if you want to mount multiple secrets, you need to specify a different `mountPath` on each one to avoid collisions. 

See the official [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret) or by running `kubectl create secret generic --help` for more details on creating and managing your secrets.
