# Working with Kibana

When you open Kibana you are prompted to select a workspace, select "Nav Logs" to start viewing your application logs.

Once the page loads you will see an empty page with a search bar. This is the query bar, and it is used to search for logs. You can use the query bar to search for logs by message, by field, or by a combination of both.

The query language is called [Kibana Query Language](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/kuery-query.html) \(KQL\). KQL is a simplified version of Lucene query syntax. You can use KQL to search for logs by message, by field, or by a combination of both.

There is also a time picker in the upper right corner of the page. You can use the time picker to select a time range to search for logs. The default time range is the last 15 minutes. If no logs shows up, try to increase the time range.
