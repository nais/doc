# Create an InfluxDB instance

!!! info "Disclaimer"

    We discourage use of [InfluxDB](README.md) for new use cases. [BigQuery](../../bigquery/README.md) might be a better fit for many use cases. Questions about Aiven and provisioning can be directed to #nais on Slack.

We use a IaC-repo to provision InfluxDB instances. Head over to [aiven-iac](https://github.com/navikt/aiven-iac#influxdb) to learn how to get your own instance.
