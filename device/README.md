# naisdevice

{% hint style="info" %}
naisdevice is currently in open beta. When released it will replace NAVTunnel/ScaleFT.
{% endhint %}

naisdevice is the mechanism used by NAV employees to connect to internal services. It is based on [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com) for connectivity and [Kolide](https://www.kolide.com/) for ensuring that the device is in a healthy state.

Until further notice naisdevice is only offered to machines that are purchased and managed by NAV. You might get som mileage off a non-NAV device, but please refrain from attempting to do so. There is a fair amount of legalese that needs interpretation before we can offer naisdevice "in the wild".

If you want to understand more about how it works, head over to the [github repository](https://github.com/nais/device) and check out the project documentation.
